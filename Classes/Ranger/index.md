# Ranger
Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.

*You must have a Dexterity score and a Wisdom score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.*

* (a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee weapons
* (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows

## Favored Foe
*1st-level ranger feature*

When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you can increase that damage by 1d4.

You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level. 

## Deft Explorer
*1st-level ranger feature; cannot be taken with Natural Explorer*

You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit below when you reach 6th level and 10th level in this class.

### Canny
*1st-level Deft Explorer ranger feature*

Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen skill. 

You can also speak, read, and write two additional languages of your choice.

### Roving
*6th-level Deft Explorer ranger feature*

Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

### Tireless
*10th-level Deft Explorer ranger feature*

As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You can use this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1. 

## Fighting Style
*2nd-level ranger feature*

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the [styles available](Fighter/Styles.md). You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

In addition, you have access to the following fighting style:

* **Druidic Warrior**
  You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list.

### Martial Versatility
Whenever you gain a level, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.

## Spellcasting
*2nd-level ranger feature*

You have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.

### Spell Slots
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Animal Friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Animal Friendship using either slot.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Spell Versatility
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the ranger spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells.

## Animal Companion
*3rd-level ranger feature*

You learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.

With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select you companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area.

At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.

If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.

If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.

## Companion's Bond
Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.

The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.

The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.

When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.

Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.

Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.

For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.

Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.

Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, "The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I
Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.

d6|Trait
--|------
1|I'm dauntless in the face of adversity.
2|Threaten my friends, threaten me.
3|I stay on alert so others can rest.
4|People see an animal and underestimate me. I use that to my advantage.
5|I have a knack for showing up in the nick of time.
6|I put my friends' needs before my own in all things.

d6|Flaw
--|----
1|If there's food left unattended, I'll eat it.
2|I growl at strangers, and all people except my ranger are strangers to me.
3|Any time is a good time for a belly rub.
4|I'm deathly afraid of water.
5|My idea of hello is a flurry of licks to the face.
6|I jump on creatures to tell them how much I love them.


## Primeval Awareness
*3rd-level ranger feature*

Your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you.

You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack. You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.

Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures' general direction and distance (in miles) from you. If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.

## Ranger Conclave
*3rd level ranger feature*

You choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave:
* [Beast Master](Ranger/BeastMaster.md)
* [Deep Stalker](Ranger/DeepStalker.md)
* [Dragonstalker](Ranger/Dragonstalker.md)
* [Drakewarden](Ranger/Drakewarden.md)
* [Fey Wanderer](Ranger/FeyWanderer.md)
* [Gloom Stalker](Ranger/GloomStalker.md)
* [Horizon Walker](Ranger/HorizonWalker.md)
* [Hunter](Ranger/Hunter.md)
* [Justicar](Ranger/Justicar.md)
* [Monster Slayer](Ranger/MonsterSlayer.md)
* [Primeval Guardian](Ranger/PrimevalGuardian.md)
* [Swarmkeeper](Ranger/Swarmkeeper.md)
* [Wrangler](Ranger/Wrangler.md)

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Greater Favored Enemy
*6th-level ranger feature*

You are ready to hunt even deadlier game. Choose a type of greater favored enemy: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fiends, or giants. You gain all the benefits against this chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy, including an additional language. Your bonus to damage rolls against all your favored enemies increases to +4.

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a greater favored enemy.

## Fleet of Foot
*8th-level ranger feature*

You can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

## Vanish
*14th-level ranger feature*

You can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

## Feral Senses
*18th-level ranger feature*

You gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

## Foe Slayer
*20th-level ranger feature*

You become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

# Ranger Spells
The following spells listed are known (but not necessarily accessible, depending on the conclave chosen) to all rangers throughout Azgaarnoth; this is not the complete list of all ranger spells, however. Certain conclaves may have additional spells that are only known to them, and thus are not accessible to other conclaves. Rangers can learn new spells by visiting druidic circles, communing with nature for significant periods of time, studying with another ranger of a different conclave, and so on. (In other words, DMs can release new ranger spells, but all rangers do not have access to them by default.)

Rangers can, at the discretion of the DM, learn spells from other druids or rangers, but generally this requires some exchange, usually a deed done on behalf of the spell's source.
