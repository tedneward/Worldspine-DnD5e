# Dragonborn
*see [Dragonborn](../Creatures/Dragonborn.md) for more details*

```
name = 'Dragonborn'
description = "***Race: Dragonborn.*** Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life."
type = 'humanoid'
```

* **Ability Score increase**. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

* **Age**. Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.

* **Alignment**. Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. However, some dragonborn seek to distance themselves from their draconic heritage, and eschew the worship of either the Platinum or Chromatic Dragon, and instead prefer to dedicate themselves to another of the gods; in fact, many dragonborn find the all-encompassing [Kaevar](../Religions/KaevarianChurch.md) to be most comfortable.

* **Size**. Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

* **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

* **Languages**. You can read, speak, and write Common and Draconic.

```
def level0(npc):
    npc.STR += 2
    npc.CHA += 1
    npc.size = 'Medium'
    npc.speed['walking'] = 30
    npc.languages.append('Common')
    npc.languages.append('Draconic')
```

## Draconic Ancestry
You are distantly related to a particular kind of dragon. Choose a type of dragon; this determines a variety of characteristics about your abilities. However, despite the general characteristics of a particular color of dragonborn, you are always free to establish your own characteristics (a noble and contemplative red, for example, or a selfish and violent gold.)

Dragonborn of chromatic colors are often chaotic, prone to violence, and sometimes selfish.
