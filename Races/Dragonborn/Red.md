### Breath Weapon
You can use your action to exhale destructive flame. It deals damage in a 15' cone. When you use your breath weapon, all creatures in the area must make a DEX saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 1d10 fire damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increase to 2d10 at 6th level, 3d10 at 11th, and 4d10 at 16th level. You may use your breath weapon a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. You regain expended uses on a long rest.

### Damage Resistance
You have resistance to fire.

### Chromatic Warding
*5th-level Red Dragonborn feature*

As an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you become immune to fire damage. Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.
