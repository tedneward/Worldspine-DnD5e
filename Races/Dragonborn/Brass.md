### Breath Weapon
You can use your action to exhale destructive fire. It deals damage in an line 5' x 30'. When you use your breath weapon, all creatures in the area must make a DEX saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 1d10 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increase to 2d10 at 6th level, 3d10 at 11th, and 4d10 at 16th level. You may use your breath weapon a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. You regain expended uses on a long rest.

### Damage Resistance
You have resistance to fire.

### Metallic Breath Weapon. 
*5th-level Brass Dragonborn feature*

You gain a second breath weapon. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. Whenever you use this trait, choose one:

* Enervating Breath. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
* Repulsion Breath. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone.
  
Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.
