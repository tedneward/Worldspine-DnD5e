## Rock gnomes
Rock gnomes are often found in the Daw Range, but also within the many hillsides that litter the continent. Surprisingly larger numbers of rock gnome settlements are found on the Al'Uma/Yithi side of the Daws, but this may be simply coincidence. Rock gnomes in Azgaarnoth are not quite as inventive as Mordenkainen posits, but the trait is found in many, and for this reason rock gnomes are often drawn to the [Order of the Steel Dragon](../../Organizations/MilitantOrders/DraconicOrder/Steel.md) and some of the larger [Merchant Guilds](../../Organizations/MerchantGuilds/index.md), particularly the Alchemists' Guilds.
