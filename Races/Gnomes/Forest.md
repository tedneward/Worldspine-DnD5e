## Forest gnomes
Forest gnome villages are found in almost every wooded area on Azgaarnoth--if you can find them. Individual forest gnomes are not common, yet they are not so rare as to draw immediate attention when they wander into town. Many of the forest gnomes have spent time with the [Glittering Eye](../../Organizations/MageSchools/GlitteringEye.md) mage school, to perfect their illusions, and often work closely with druids to maintain their forest home when threatened.
