## Domain Spells
Starting at 1st level, you gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Life Domain Spells table. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

## Bonus Proficiency
*1st-level Life Domain feature*

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

```
    for arm in armor['heavy']:
        npc.addproficiency(arm)
```

## Disciple of Life
*1st-level Life Domain feature*

Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

```
    npc.traits.append("***Disciple of Life.*** Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.")
```

## Channel Divinity: Preserve Life
*2nd-level Life Domain feature*

You can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

```
def level2(npc):
    npc.defer(lambda npc: npc.actions.append(f"***Channel Divinity: Preserve Life.*** You present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore {5 * npc.levels('Cleric')} hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.") )
```

## Blessed Healer
*6th-level Life Domain feature*

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

```
def level6(npc):
    npc.traits.append("***Blessed Healer.*** hen you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.")
```

## Divine Strike
*8th-level Life Domain feature*

You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

```
def level8(npc):
    npc.defer(lambda npc: npc.actions.append(f"***Divine Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra {1 if npc.levels('Cleric') < 14 else 2}d8 radiant damage to the target.") )
```

## Supreme Healing
*17th-level Life Domain feature*

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

```
def level17(npc):
    npc.traits.append("***Supreme Healing.*** When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.")
```
