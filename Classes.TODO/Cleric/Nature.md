# Divine Domain: Nature
Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself; from inscrutable gods of the deep forests to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves. Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.

This domain is available to those who worship in the [Almalzish](../../Religions/AlUma.md#almalzish-cleric) or [*al'maeran*](../../Religions/AlUma.md#almaeran-cleric) traditions, as part of the [Kaevarian Church](../../Religions/KaevarianChurch.md), [Trinitarians who worship Leriya](../../Religions/Trinitarian.md#leriya), or those who revere the Pantheonic gods [Auril](../../Religions/Pantheon/Auril.md), [Brigantia](../../Religions/Pantheon/Brigantia.md), [Daghda](../../Religions/Pantheon/Daghda.md), [Ehlonna](../../Religions/Pantheon/Ehlonna.md), [Silvanus](../../Religions/Pantheon/Silvanus.md), ...

## Domain Spells
Starting at 1st level, you gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Nature Domain Spells table. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

## Acolyte of Nature
At 1st level, you learn one cantrip of your choice from the [druid "core" spell list](../Druid/index.md#core-druid-spells). You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival.

## Bonus Proficiency
Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

## Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to charm animals and plants.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.

## Dampen Elements
Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.

## Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

## Master of Nature
At 17th level, you gain the ability to command animals and plant creatures. While creatures are charmed by your Charm Animals and Plants feature, you can take a bonus action on your turn to verbally command what each of those creatures will do on its next turn.
