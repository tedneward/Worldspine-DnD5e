Once you do, the spell is discharged and no longer infuses the object.

The spell discharges on its own without affecting anything when you finish a long rest. It also does so if you use this invocation again, or if you end your tum more than 300 feet away from the cursed item.

### Hag's Heritage
*Prerequisite: Progenitor Patron*

You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, magic can't put you to sleep, and you are a fey instead of your normal creature type. Also, you gain proficiency in your choice of either Deception, Perception, or Stealth, and you can speak, read, and write your choice of either AbyssaL Giant, Primordial or Sylvan.

In addition, you can use an action to cover yourself and anything you are wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes you look like an ugly creature of your general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if you take a bonus action to end it or if you die.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, you could appear to have no hair, but someone touching your head might feel your hair, if you have any hair. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a Intelligence (Investigation) check against your warlock spell save DC to tell you are disguised

However, you also have the following flaws:

* **Foul Hunger.** You must eat five times as much food as normal for your size, but humanoid flesh counts as five times as much food for you.

* **Hideous Countenance.** Your true appearance is ugly, and those who see your true form or your cursed form may become disgusted or worse. Whenever a creature sees either your true form or your cursed form for the first time, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or else it becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek to flee from you or make you leave the area in nonviolent ways (at the DM's discretion1 depending on the nature of your interaction with it.
