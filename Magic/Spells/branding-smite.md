The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, the target is marked with a symbol of your hostile intent. The attack deals an extra 6d6 radiant damage, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is magically branded with a glowing symbol that lasts for the duration. You can use a bonus action to activate the magic of the symbol. When the symbol's magic is activated, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half damage. If the target takes any damage while stunned by this spell, it is no longer stunned. Huge and larger creatures have advantage on the Constitution saving throw. Gargantuan creatures are not stunned by this spell.
