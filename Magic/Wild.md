# Magic: Wild Magic
Normally, the power wielded by those who can tap into it via arcane means do so by putting careful restrictions and limitations on it. In its raw form, this power is chaotic and unpredictable, and can cause all manner of effects both beneficial and harmful to the surrounding area.

Some arcane casters, however, have sought ways to tap into this uncontrolled force, allowing it into this world without tight controls, believing that doing so is a path to greater power. This "wild mages", as they came to be known, were particularly popular during the 

## Wild Magic Surge
A wild magic surge can happen in a variety of ways, and the effects are entirely unpredictable. If the wild surge is triggered by an individual creature's actions, roll d100 on the Individual Wild Magic Surge Effect table, below; if the surge is triggered by something else, roll on the Area Wild Magic Surge table.

Any attack on one of you will immediately trigger an attack from the other against whatever creature (friend or foe) made the attack.

**Area Wild Magic Surge Effect**

d100  | Effect
----- | -------
01-02 | Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns (or Initiative 20) for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.
03-04 | A creature at random within the zone feet disappears, reappearing 1 round later in exactly the same place, with no time having passed for that creature.
05-06 | All creatures within the zone are [blinded](../Conditions/Blinded.md) and [deafened](../Conditions/Deafened.md) for 1 minute, but gain tremorsense out to 60 feet.
07-08 | For the next minute, all creatures within 60 feet roll 1d10 at the start of each of their turns; if the die roll is odd, they gain that number of hit points, and if the die roll is even, they lose that number of hit points.	
09-10 | All creatures within 60 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 25 or go [berserk](../Conditions/Berserk.md) for 1 minute.
11-12 | The entire area smells of fish. Any creature that navigates or uses smell as a sense is immediately [blinded](../Conditions/Blinded.md) unless it is a creature that normally lives in the sea. Constructs and undead are not affected by this.
13-14 | It rains literal cats and dogs for 1 round. Each creature will be randomly subjected to 1d4-1 falling cats or dogs, causing 1d4 bludgeon damage to any creature hit by a dog and 1d6 slashing damage to any creature hit by a cat. The dogs and cats run around in confusion for 1 round thereafter (making the terrain difficult), then dissipate.
15-16 | Everyone in the zone has to make a DC 15 Con save; on a failed save, they fall asleep ([unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md)) for 1d4 rounds. They can attempt a new save on the start of each round.
17-18 | Butterflies and flower petals flutter in the air throughout the zone for the next minute. Visibility in the area is considered obscured.
19-20 | A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in the zone, then disappears 1 minute later.
21-22 | The smell of cinnamon fills the area.
23-24 | A sinkhole, 10 feet deep and 20 feet in diameter, appears at a random location within the zone. Creatures caught within the radius must make an immediate Dexterity/DC20 save. On a failed save, they fall into the sinkhole, taking falling damage if appropriate. On a successful save, creatures move to the nearest location that is not within the sinkhole's radius.
25-26 | Fog seeps up from the ground, obscuring everything within the zone.
27-28 | A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space inside the zone, then disappears 1 minute later.

31-32 | Each creature within within the wild magic zone takes 1d10 necrotic damage and is [necrotized](../Conditions/Necrotized.md). One creature, chosen at random, regains hit points equal to the sum of the necrotic damage dealt.
33-34 | The shadow of each creature within the zone detaches from them and becomes a [shadow](../Creatures/Shadow.md). Each shadow immediately attacks the creature it detached from. If the shadow is defeated, the creature's shadow returns; if not, the creature's body fades into mist and the shadow flees.
35-36 | Each creature in the zone is charged with lightning. The first time any creature touches another, regardless of intent, the recipient takes 1d6 lightning damage. Melee weapon attacks that result in a hit discharge the lightning; misses do not. Ranged weapon attacks do not discharge. Being touched does not trigger this discharge. If a creature has not discharged the lightning within 3 rounds, it discharges against themselves, and inflicts 2d6 lightning damage.
37-38 | A [storm of elemental fury](Spells/storm-of-elemental-fury.md) erupts, centered on the (rough) center of the wild magic zone.
39-40 | [Silence](Spells/silence.md) falls on the entire zone. All creatures are treated as if they are [deafened](../Conditions/Deafened.md). The effect lasts for 1d10 rounds. No spells with a verbal component may be cast from within the zone, and no speech of any kind may be uttered. Thieves' cant, with its gestures, can be used to communicate basic concepts if both speaker and recipient are proficient in it. Telepathy functions normally.
41-42 | An [antimagic field](Spells/antimagic-field.md) fills the zone. It lasts for 1d6 rounds, and during this time, even as the antimagic field affects the creatures within the zone, a new Area Wild Surge Effect takes place each round, in conjunction with this one. If this effect is rolled while this effect is still in place, the two cancel each other out.
43-44 | Aa uncontrolled [sphere of annihilation](Items/sphere-of-annihiliation.md) appears in an unoccupied space in the center of the wild magic zone.
45-46 | All creatures within the zone are immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 5d6 days. They are all each aware of this effect, though they do not know how or why.
47-48 | If any creature within the wild magic zone takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage within the next minute, they gain resistance to that type of damage for 1 hour.
49-50 | 1d6 [flumphs](../Creatures/Flumph.md) controlled by the DM appear in unoccupied spaces within the wild magic zone. They vanish after 1 minute.
51-52 | Strong winds swirl throughout the entirety of the wild magic zone for 1d10 minutes. During this time, no ranged weapon attack will hit its target, although ranged spell attacks are made at disadvantage.
53-54 | Up to 6 corpses within the zone rise as zombies within the zone, and are hostile to all non-undead creatures.
55-56 | All water within the wild magic zone evaporates instantly. Any water-based creature (such as a water elemental) immediately take 2d6 damage.
57-58 | All creatures within the wild magic zone have [haste](Spells/haste.md) cast on them for 3 rounds. When it wears off, each creature suffers 2 levels of [exhaustion](../Conditions/Exhaustion.md) for 1d6 hours.
59-60 | A chorus of ethereal voices begin to make compliments and offer criticism on everything that is happening inside the wild magic zone. For example, they may congratulate the caster on casting the spell and compliment the quality of both the casting and the spell itself. Anytime anyone uses magic within an hour of the casting of the original spell, they are met with the murmured approval and commentary of the voices.
61-62 | Each creature in the wild magic zone is launched ten feet into the air, hangs there for a moment (permitting a reaction), then falls back down, taking falling damage.
63-64 | 1d8 Medium-sized purple tentacles rise from the ground throughout the wild magic zone. They are not aligned to any creatures within the zone, and attempt to grapple (Athletics/DC 14) anything within their reach of 10 feet. If they succeed, each round they deliver (randomly) either 1d6 healing or 1d6 necrotic damage. They have AC 15, 25 hit points, and will retreat back into the ground after 1 minute.
65-66 | All creatures change places, randomly teleporting to a different place formerly occupied by another creature.
67-68 | A [fog cloud](Spells/fog-cloud.md) descends to fill the wild magic zone.
69-70 | All creatures inside the wild magic zone each roll 1d6 twice, the first die roll indicating what kind of damage the creature gains immunity to, the second die roll indicating what kind of damage the creature gains vulnerability to: 1-2 bludgeoning damage; 3-4 piercing damage, 5-6 slashing damage. This effect lasts for 1 minute.
71-72 | For the next minute, at the start of each round, the DM secretly rolls a d10; if the die roll is odd, all damage-based spells cure their targets instead, and all curative spells do necrotic or radiant (whichever is worse to that creature) damage instead. A creature can attempt an Arcana/DC25 check to tell which effect is in place.

If a surge effect replicates a spell which normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration. Some effects call for a saving throw; the saving throw DC is equal to your spell save DC (if the surge was triggered by a spell) or the item save DC (if the surge was triggered by a magic item).

## Wild Magic Zones
Sometimes the release of wild magic takes root temporarily within a given area, creating what's known as a wild magic zone. These zones appear without warning, but most commonly in response to the use of wild magic (typically by a [Wild Magic sorcerer](../Classes/Sorcerer/WildMagic.md) or a [Wild Mage](../Classes/Wizard/WildMagic.md), though zones have appeared in response to the rage of a [Wild Magic barbarian](../Classes/Barbarian/WildMagic.md) or even sometimes to the actions of a [Chaos](../Classes/Cleric/Chaos.md) or [Madness](../Classes/Cleric/Madness.md) cleric.) These zones are often small, measuring no more than 60 to 100 feet in diameter in a roughly circular shape, but zones as small as a single 5-foot square or as large as entire city blocks have been reported in the past. Legend tells of an entire city that disappeared into a wild magic zone, though not of what happened to it afterwards.

In addition to the effects of certain character classes' actions, a wild magic surge can be triggered by anyone who casts a spell (including cantrips), activates a magical item, or uses a magical ability while inside a wild magic zone, due to the unstable arcane forces that permeate that space. Note that for magical items, only the activation of an item will trigger a surge--a *+1 longsword*, for example, does not need to be activated to have its effects, but a *wand of magic missiles* must be activated in order to function, and would therefore trigger a surge. Generally speaking, only those items with charges (which then in turn require activation in order to function) will trigger a surge.

These zones are often unsettling to practitioners of arcane magic; Bards, Sorcerers, and Wizards can make a Perception/DC15 check to sense the nature of the area. Sometimes, visual clues (strangely-colored or brightly-lit flora, for example, or strange etheral music or flickering lights) can provide advantage on the check.

***Using magic in a wild magic zone.*** Creatures can cast spells without difficulty (unless specified otherwise). Generally, the normal effects of a cast spell apply, in addition to any surge effects. Spells cast in a wild magic zone 

***Mantaining control in wild magic zones.*** While inside a wild magic zone, you can try to mantain control over a spell and prevent a surge from happening by succeeding on an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. It's impossible, however, to avoid surges caused by the activation of a magic item while inside a wild magic zone.

93	Instead of the intended effect, 10d10 trees in the area grow mouths, and begin singing for 1d8 rounds. If the original spell was supposed to be a spell of healing, the song is a rousing chorus that washes away fatigue and ends any emotional (fear, charm, etc.) effect that is currently afflicting any that hear it. If the original spell was supposed to be an attack spell, the song is an irresistible tune that catches up all that hear it into singing it with the trees, and all the attitudes of the combatants is changed to neutral towards each other when the song ends. If the spell was supposed to be anything else, the song is a soothing song that makes the listeners sleepy, making it hard to take reactionary attacks until the song ends.
