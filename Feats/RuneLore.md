## Rune Lore
You have learned one of the [Runes](../Magic/Runes.md) of the Eldar. You know one rune (so long as you meet all the prerequisites for that rune), and cannot learn any more unless taking this feat a second (or more) time.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.
