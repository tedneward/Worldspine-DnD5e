## Channeler
You are one of the rare people who have the innate talent to control raw magic and express it in raw, fiery form.

This grants the following benefits:

* If you already have channeling dice, you gain one more; otherwise, you have two channeling dice, which are d6's. These channeling dice are used to fuel the uses described below. A channeling die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended channeling dice when you finish a long rest. If you are in an area where spells are suppressed or cannot be cast (such as an [antimagic field](../Magic/Spells/antimagic-field.md) spell), you cannot use channeling dice. If you are inside a [wild magic zone](../Magic/Wild.md#wild-magic-zones), you can take an action to regain all of your channeling dice. You can only spend 1 channeling die per turn.
* When you take cold damage or damage from a spell, you can use your reaction to expend 1 or more channeling dice and regain hit points equal to the total number rolled on your channeling dice.
* Whenever you inflict fire damage with a spell or cantrip, you can use your bonus action to expend 1 or more channeling dice to inflict extra damage against one target of that fire damage (even if that target took no fire damage due to immunity or a similar effect). The target takes force damage equal to your total channeling dice roll, and you can push the target up to 10 feet away from you.
* As an action, you can expend 1 channeling die to cast [detect magic](../Magic/Spells/detect-magic.md).
* Whenever you spend 1 or more channeling dice, you shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you spend 4 or more channeling dice at once, these radii are doubled.
* As long as you have at least one unexpended channeling die remaining, you are considered naturally adapted to cold climates, and you have the ability to start fires with a touch. As an action, you can magically ignite a flammable object you touch with your hand--an object such as a torch, a piece of tinder, or the hem of drapes.
* You learn the [produce flame](../Magic/Spells/produce-flame.md) cantrip.
