## Intelligent Caster
*Prerequisite: One or more levels in at least one class that allows you to cast spells using Charisma or Wisdom as your spellcasting ability*

Though spellcasting abilities of a type you practice are usually fueled by faith or force of personality, your own approach focuses more on study, rigor, and education. This feat grants the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Choose one class in which you have at least one level, which grants you the Spellcasting class feature, and which specifies Charisma or Wisdom as the spellcasting ability for its Spellcasting feature. Your spellcasting ability for the Spellcasting feature provided by that class becomes Intelligence instead of Charisma or Wisdom.
* You become proficient in the Arcana skill if you are not already.
* You learn one cantrip of your choice from the wizard's spell list.
* If Charisma or Wisdom is a prerequisite for multiclassing from the class you chose for this feat, you may substitute Intelligence for Charisma or Wisdom when multiclassing from that class.
