## Greater Dragonmark
*Prerequisite: 8th level, Character must possess a dragonmark*

Your dragonmark has grown in size and power. This enhances your existing dragonmark, and the benefits are based on the mark that you already possess. A greater dragonmark provides the following benefits:

* The die type of your dragonmarked Intuition Die increases by one.
* Increase one ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20. The abilities available to you are based on your mark, as shown on the Greater Dragonmark Benefits table.
* You learn a set of spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot or using a material component. The list of spells, the spellcasting ability for these spells, and the type of rest you must complete in order to regain the use of these spells are shown on the Greater Dragonmark Benefits table.

To cast [Leomund's secret chest](../Magic/Spells/leomunds-secret-chest.md) using this feat and the [Mark of Warding](/Races/Dragonmarked.md#the-mark-of-warding), you must have a dragonshard with a value of at least 100 gp. While you have this dragonshard in hand, it serves as the spell's focus, and you can use it to summon and dismiss the chest.
