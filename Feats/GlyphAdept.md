## Glyph Adept
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast 3rd-level spells*

Sigils and symbols hold power, as the scholars of the Eldar have long known, and some spellcasters have perfected the art of storing spells in magical glyphs.

You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You add [glyph of warding](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/glyph-of-warding/) to your spells known or prepared. It is a class spell for you and doesn't count against the
number of spells you know or can have prepared.
* When you cast [glyph of warding](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/glyph-of-warding/), its casting time is reduced to 10 minutes.
* When you cast [glyph of warding](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/glyph-of-warding/) to produce explosive runes, you can have the runes deal acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder damage.
* If another creature attempts to counter or dispel a [glyph of warding](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/glyph-of-warding/) you cast, your glyph is treated as being 1 level higher than the level at which you actually cast it.
* Once you are able to cast 7th-level spells (or if you are already able to), you add [symbol](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/symbol/) to your spells known or prepared. It is a class spell for you and doesn't count against the number of spells you know or can have prepared.
