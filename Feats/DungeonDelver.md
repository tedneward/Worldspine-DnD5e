## Dungeon Delver
Alert to the hidden traps and secret doors found in many dungeons, you gain the following benefits:

* Traveling at a fast pace doesn't impose the normal −5 penalty on your passive Wisdom (Perception) score.
* You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps.
* You have resistance to the damage dealt by traps.
* You can search for traps while traveling at a normal pace, instead of only at a slow pace
