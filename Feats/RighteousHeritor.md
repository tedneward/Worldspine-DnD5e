## Righteous Heritor
*Prerequisite: 4th Level, [Scion of the Outer Planes (Good Outer Plane) Feat](#scion-of-the-outer-planes)*

You can channel the cosmic forces of good that foster serenity and fellowship. You are still free to choose your own actions, but gain these benefits:

* **Ability Score Increase.** Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* **Soothe Pain.** When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to dull its suffering and reduce the damage it takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
