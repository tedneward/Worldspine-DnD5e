# Goblins
Goblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, and other dismal settings. Individually weak, goblins gather in large — sometimes overwhelming — numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.

***Goblinoids.*** Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins have a reputation that they are lazy and undisciplined. But as they have adopted more and more to the world in which they find themselves, they are demonstrating that they can be anything but, making them excellent servants, laborers, leaders, and guards.

***Leaders and Followers.*** In their early days, goblins were ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe's survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs. As the goblins began to see the benefits of civilization--particularly how many smaller goblins could stand up to the few strongest, including hobgoblins and bugbears--goblins began to adopt many of the trappings and behaviors of their civilized neighbors. Thus today, goblins can span the entire range of civilization.

***Challenging Lairs.*** Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can't navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies.

***Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders.*** Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.

***Worshipers of Maglubiyet.*** Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron. This is a "privilege" that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One's eternal tyranny even more than death.

***Maglubiyet's Forgotten.*** Many goblins have come to believe that their Mighty One has all but forgotten about them, and as a result, have found spiritual homes with many of the other gods, or even in the Great God, Kaevar. Other goblins (and their hobgoblin cousins) have sworn off religion entirely. Those goblins who still worship Maglubiyet call these goblins "the Forgotten", and often seek to remind their atheistic or agnostic cousins of why it is goblins fear the Lord of Depths and Darkness.

## Goblin Warrior

## Goblin Veteran
Those goblins who've served in a military capacity are rare, but much tougher than the average goblin. They frequently are much less prone to rash acts, and often look to their own safety by keeping peers and comrades alive, rather than scrambling in retreat.

## Goblin Boss
The goblin boss is often the biggest brute in a group of uncivilized goblins, acting in a "leadership" capacity by sheer size and brutality. They often back down quickly in the face of a bigger brute, and usually pick a few less-intelligent big brutes to act as their lieutenants and bodyguards.

## Goblin Bodyguard
Not every goblin tough has it in it to become a boss. Even briefly maintaining rule over a lair requires considerable force of will. Tougher goblins without the drive to rule are usually singled out as bodyguards for those with it. About the only dependable fighting force of goblins not under hobgoblin command is a squad of goblin bodyguards defending their lair.

## Goblin King
Periodically a goblin boss grows so powerful that other bosses submit to its rule. This "overboss" can be proclaimed a king or queen. The reign of a goblin king or queen is usually violently short, but in a few rare places one manages to found a lasting subterranean kingdom. It is more common to encounter an exiled goblin king and his bodyguards out raiding vulnerable areas on the outskirts of civilization, hoping to acquire enough booty to attract a new Horde.

## Goblin Worg Rider
Those goblins who are selected to ride the powerful goblinoid-wolves known as [Worgs](Wolves.md#worg) are tougher, faster, and meaner than their on-foot cousins. Worg riders are feared among the goblins, and many a worg rider has gone on to become a boss in their own right later in life. A Worg rider bonds with its worg, and the pair are inseparable for their (often brief) lives.

Some Goblin Worg Riders have learned to ride [Dire Wolves](Wolves.md#dire-wolf) or [Hell Hounds](Dogs.md#hell-hound) instead; those goblins are generally considered insane by their fellows, and live in expectation of an even shorter lifespan.

## Nilbog
When Maglubiyet conquered the goblin gods, a trickster deity was determined to get the last laugh. Although Maglubiyet shattered its essence, this trickster god survives in a splintered form as possessing spirits that cause disorder unless they are appeased. Goblins have no name for this deity and dare not give it one, lest Maglubiyet use its name to ensnare and crush it as he did their other deities. They call the possessing spirit, as well as the goblin possessed by it, a nilbog ("goblin" spelled backward), and they revel in the chaos a nilbog sows.

Whenever goblinoids form a host, there is a chance that a goblin will become possessed by a nilbog, particularly if the goblins have been mistreated by their betters. The possessed goblin turns into a wisecracking, impish creature fearless of reprisal. This nilbog also gains strange powers that drive others to do the opposite of what they desire. Attacking the possessed goblin is foolhardy, and killing them just prompts the spirit to possess another goblin. The only way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havoc is to treat it well and give it respect and praise.

Among fey courts, the risk of attracting a nilbog has given rise to the practice of always including at least one goblin jester. This jester is allowed to go anywhere and do whatever they please, hopefully preventing a nilbog from manifesting. The position of jester is much sought-after among the courts' goblins, because even if the jester is obviously not a nilbog, the court must indulge their chaotic behavior.

A nilbog is an invisible spirit that possesses only goblins. When bereft of a host, the spirit has a flying speed of 30 feet, it can't be attacked, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. Acting on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the only action it can take is to attempt to possess a goblin within 5 feet of it.

A goblin targeted by the spirit must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become possessed. While possessed, the goblin uses the nilbog stat block. If the save succeeds, the spirit can't possess that goblin for 24 hours.

If its host is killed or the possession is ended by a spell such as hallow, magic circle, or protection from evil and good, the spirit searches for another goblin to possess. The spirit can leave its host at any time, but it won't do so willingly unless it knows there's another potential host nearby. A goblin stripped of their nilbog spirit reverts to their normal statistics and loses the traits they gained while possessed.
