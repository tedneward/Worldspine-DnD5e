# Crabs
Most of the time, these crustaceans are harmless and make for good eats. These are found on nearly every beach or seashore across Azgaarnoth, and thanks to their pentiful nature, are a common staple in most commoners' diets. Some, however, grow to more threatening size and take poorly to those who would capture them. Still good eats, though.

## Giant Crab
Giant crabs are usually found in the depths of the Deepwaters, where prey large enough to sustain them can be found; periodically, giant crabs will wander surfaceward in search of easier prey, however, and many have found that small fishing boats can make for an excellent supplement to their usual diet.
