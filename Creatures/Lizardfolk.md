# Lizardfolk
Lizardfolk are reptilian humanoids that both lurk in the swamps and jungles of the world, as well as in small but bustling towns and villages near (or within) those same swamps and jungles. Their hut villages thrive in forbidding grottoes, half-sunken ruins, and watery caverns, while their villages and towns--really just larger versions of the hut villages but with more population and better construction--often line the edges of the swamp or jungle, frequently acting as a trading station between "civilized" races and their more primitive cousins.

***Territorial Xenophobes.*** Lizardfolk deal and trade with other races only rarely. Fiercely territorial, they use camouflaged scouts to guard the perimeter of their domain. When unwelcome visitors are detected, a tribe sends a hunting band to harass or drive the trespassers off, or tricks them into blundering into the lairs of crocodiles and other dangerous creatures.

In the wild, lizardfolk have no notion of traditional morality, and they find the concepts of good and evil utterly alien. Truly neutral creatures, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive. However, many have found influences that take them beyond their original (bestial) nature, and have adopted habits and culture reminiscient of the other "civilized" races on Azgaarnoth.

Lizardfolk rarely stray beyond their claimed hunting grounds. Any creature that enters their territory is fair game to be stalked, killed, and devoured. They make no distinction between humanoids, beasts, and monsters. Similarly, lizardfolk don't like reaching too far beyond their borders, where they could easily become the hunted instead of the hunters. This is true of both "wild" lizardfolk and "civilized" ones--each prefers to stay home, and guards their borders jealously.

Occasions might arise when lizardfolk will form alliances with their neighbors. These lizardfolk usually learn firsthand that humans, dwarves, halflings, and elves can sometimes prove helpful or trustworthy. Once lizardfolk forge ties with outsiders, they are steadfast and fierce allies.

***Great Feasts and Sacrifices.*** Lizardfolk are omnivorous, but they have a taste for humanoid flesh. Prisoners are often taken back to their camps to become the centerpieces of great feasts and rites involving dancing, storytelling, and ritual combat. Victims are either cooked and eaten by the tribe, or are sacrificed to Semuanya, the lizardfolk god.

***Canny Crafters.*** Though they aren't skilled artisans, lizardfolk craft tools and ornamental jewelry out of the bones of their kills, and they use the hides and shells of dead monsters to create shields.

***Playable Race: Natural Warriors.*** [Lizardfolk](../Races/Lizardfolk.md) are often quite deeply in tune with their natural surroundings, and as such make natural barbarians, druids and rangers. Clerics (and paladins) will often pray to either their lizardfolk gods (Semuanya, a protector god that seeks lizardfolk elevation into civilization, or Sess'inek, a god that seeks to corrupt the lizardfolk), or to gods of [Nature](../Classes/Cleric/Nature.md), [Fertility](../Classes/Cleric/Fertility.md), [Ocean](../Classes/Cleric/Ocean.md), or [Water](../Classes/Cleric/War.md). Warlocks, shamans, and sorcerers are common, less so wizards or artificers. Lizardfolk bards are generally only appreciated by other lizardfolk, and lizardfolk pale masters are generally shunned entirely by both lizardfolk and non-lizardfolk. Lizardfolk have seen mystics come from their ranks, but not many.

## Lizardfolk
The average lizardfolk tribe member, of either gender, is slightly smaller and less aggressive than the lizardfolk most others encounter except when in a lizardfolk village or town. They are no less fierce or aggressive, however, when duty or threats compel them to take up arms to defend their own.

## Lizardfolk Hunter
Lizardfolk hunters are those lizardfolk who routinely journey out of the village borders to obtain prey, scout for intruders, and report on what occurs beyond the heart of the village. Many hunters find themselves drawn to combat, and become warriors, while others hear the call of nature more directly, and become druids or rangers.

## Lizardfolk Warrior
Warriors are the defenders of the tribe, steeped in combat and sometimes even tactics. In more civilized towns and villages, they will don armor and use modern weapons.

***Mounted Warriors.*** Lizardfolk warriors will often make use of [Giant Lizards](./Lizard.md#giant-lizard) as mounts in combat, and these pairings are often lifelong bonds between warrior and mount. They two may act on the same initiative, and combine their actions.

## Lizardfolk King/Queen
Lizardfolk born in Sess'inek's image are larger and more cunning than other lizardfolk, and are thoroughly evil. These lizard "kings" and "queens" dominate lizardfolk tribes, usurping a shaman's authority and inspiring uncharacteristic aggression among their subjects. Some have managed to slip past Sess'inek's grasp, while others have been put down by a concerted effort of lizardfolk villagers that seek to evade their evil god's domination.

***Dragon Worshipers.*** Lizardfolk speak Draconic, which they are thought to have learned from dragons in ancient times. A tribe that wanders into the territory of a dragon will offer it tribute to win its favor. An evil dragon might exploit lizardfolk for its own vile ends, turning them into raiders and plunderers. For this reason, many lizardfolk are sought out as allies of the [Wyrmcult](../Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), and many lizardfolk villages and towns often hide Wyrmcult secrets. It is for these same reasons that many "westerners" distrust the lizardfolk, even those that have nothing to do with the chromatic dragons and their cultists.
