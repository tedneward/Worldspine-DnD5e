# Slaadi
Slaadi are beings of pure chaos, native to the outer plane of Limbo, vaguely resembling humanoid salamanders. There's no good reason for them to be hanging out on the prime material plane, but being beings of chaos, they don't need one; in fact, they don't need a good reason to be doing anything.

> Jump to: [Slaad Tadpole](#slaad-tadpole) | [Red Slaad](#red-slaad) | [Blue Slaad](#blue-slaad) | [Green Slaad](#green-slaad) | [Brown Slaad](#brown-slaad) | [Cyan Slaad](#cyan-slaad) | [Indigo Slaad](#indigo-slaad) | [Orange Slaad](#orange-slaad) | [Gray Slaad](#gray-slaad) | [Death Slaad](#death-slaad)

In their base form, slaadi resemble large, bipedal frogs with long, sharp claws, wide mouths filled with pointed teeth and huge heads. Embedded in most of their skulls is a gemstone the size and shape of a human child's fist, a jewel that shared their color and that could be barely seen beneath their forehead skin. Looking closely, one can see that symbols are carved into the shard, markings unique to the slaad which could be used to determine its past kills, conquests, duels and other deeds. If one could decipher the meaning of the tattoo, it could be used to determine the relative strength of the slaad, with other slaads being able to immediately identify the slaad by their mark.

Despite generally sharing the same basic, if baffling, appearance, slaadi are nonetheless creatures of chaos and so no two are exactly identical. They always have at least mild differences in height, build and eye position even within their own subtype, some breeds being human-sized and gangly while others were huge and muscular, and many possess even more distinguishing traits. Slaads of the same color breed could vary not only in their exact shade and pattern but also be of the opposite color entirely. However, their gemstones are always of the breed's color--red slaad gemstones will always be red, and will not change unless the slaad's breed does.

Other potential differences include additional body parts and organs, features of greater or lesser size, various body types, and wholly unique features like horns, scales, tails and hair. More outlandish traits, such as blade-like claws, wings whether functional or not, and even a medusa's snake-like hair, are also fully possible. It is also possible that, given that some of the more powerful slaadi have polymorphing abilities which allow them to transform into humanoids, often those of their original hosts, that one might not even recognize a slaad upon meeting them.

***History.*** Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.

However, this legend may not be entirely correct--some planar scholars have theorized that the slaadi are actually refugees from previous universes/multiverses that were destroyed somehow, and the shock of the transition drove them to their current chaotic mindset. Or one theory holds that slaadi are creatures that embraced Chaos as a power source, and it slowly (or quickly) corrupted them into the slaadi they are today. In all of these stories, however, the one constant is the Spawning Stone, and the slaadi's equal reverence and hatred of it.

***Slaadi Control Gems.*** Every slaadi born from the Spawning Stone or ever in close proximity to the ancient artifact contains a piece of the Spawning Stone in their brain called a control gem. These gems can be magically extracted from a slaad using old magic and risky surgeries. Once someone holds a slaad's control gem, they control the slaad. However, if the gem is ever destroyed, the holder no longer controls the slaad. It is believed that just as a slaad is controlled by its control gem, if one could control the Spawning Stone, one could gain control over all slaadi throughout the planes.

Scholars disagree on whether these control gems will regrow if removed and destroyed; what is known is that just as many slaadi encountered have them as those that don't. Despite the obvious convenience of using a control gem to control its underlings, no slaadi has ever been seen using a control gem to control other slaadi. 

Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against [imprisonment](../Magic/Spells/imprisonment.md), the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A [wish](../Magic/Spells/wish.md) spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.

A [greater restoration](../Magic/Spells/greater-restoration.md) spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.

Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.

***Birth and Transformation.*** Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.

***Interaction.*** As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi can't be said to have common reactions to any particular race other than "whatever the slaadi feels like doing at the moment". Some of the upper hierarchy slaadi may have long-term plans that include alliance or betrayal of others, but generally the lower in the hierarchy, the more chaotic the slaadi reaction. In general, however, a few things seem consistent: Slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight, and treat all gith with contempt and hatred.

The important thing to remember is that slaad are creatures of Chaos. While Order is imprisoned in its preordained path, Chaos is so fickle it can never make real headway, always caught in shifting sands. If slaad were just a bit more organized they would be nigh unstoppable, but they simply can't help themselves. Their constantly shifting goals means they can never make even moderately long connections or alliances. A slaad may be planting eggs one moment, become interested in poetry the next, and just as quickly begin slaughtering all around them.

## Red Slaad
Red slaadi are 8 ft (2.4 m) tall bipeds that weighs approximately 650 lb (290 kg), resembling a roughly humanoid, almost neckless toad with huge, flat heads. Their skin is mostly dull red with specks of gray, lighter around their undersides and darker along their back, and occasionally covered by loincloths (depending on the slaadi's intelligence and surroundings).

![](Slaad-Red.png)

When a red slaad claws a humanoid creature, it can inject an egg from a gland under one of its claws. The egg works its way into its host and gestates, eventually forming a slaad tadpole. Such a tadpole then eats its way out of the host's body, feeds on the host's remains, and then seeks any other fresh meat it can find. The tadpole transforms into a fully grown blue slaad -- or green slaad if the host had the ability to cast 3rd level spells or higher -- within 2d12 hours.

***Tactics.*** Red slaadi are dumb brutes without Stealth but with the major damage resistances. They're vicious toe-to-toe melee fighters, with lots of hit points and very high Strength and Constitution, and their goal is to deposit their eggs or bacteriophages in humanoid hosts, so they'll want to make as many claw attacks as possible against as many targets as possible. They're indiscriminate in target selection, directing their attacks at the nearest humanoid enemy whom they haven't already hit with a claw attack. (Once they've clawed a target, they have no way of knowing whether they've managed to infect him or her; they just assume success and move on to the next target.) On each turn, they use their Multiattack to claw/claw/bite, attacking the same target again only if both claw attacks miss. Once they've clawed every humanoid in the immediate area, they Dash away in search of another group of humanoid targets.

>
>A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.

>If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated.

## Blue Slaad
Blue slaadi are 10‑foot-tall (3‑meter) bipeds that weigh approximately 1,000 lb (450 kg), resembling roughly humanoid toads with light, electric blue skin marked by grey streaks. Bone hooks protrude from the back of the blue slaad's hands.

![](Slaad-Blue.png)

The bone hooks that protrude from the back of a blue slaad's hands inflict a terrible transformative disease on humanoids wounded by them. This infection, called chaos phage, transforms its victim into a fully grown red slaad -- or green slaad if the host was a spellcaster able to cast 3rd level spells or higher.

***Tactics.*** Blue slaadi are dumb brutes without Stealth but with the major damage resistances. They're vicious toe-to-toe melee fighters, with lots of hit points and very high Strength and Constitution, and their goal is to deposit their eggs or bacteriophages in humanoid hosts, so they'll want to make as many claw attacks as possible against as many targets as possible.

On each turn, they use their Multiattack to claw/claw/bite, attacking the same target again only if both claw attacks miss. Once they've clawed every humanoid in the immediate area, they Dash away in search of another group of humanoid targets.

If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called chaos phage. While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.

## Green Slaad
Green slaadi are surprisingly intelligent and possess innate spellcasting ability. A green slaad can change its shape to appear as a humanoid. Many of them adopt the forms of their former hosts, traveling the mortal world to find the knowledge needed to become a gray slaad.

![](Slaad-Green.png)

At some unpredictable point in its existence, a green slaad unlocks the means to magically, instantly, and permanently transform itself into a gray slaad. Unlocking this knowledge can take years, even decades, and some rumors abound of even longer incubation periods.

***Potent Spellcasters.*** Some green slaad have the spellcasting capabilities of the host from which it was spawned; these can be fearsomely powerful casters, and some green slaad have even gone further and continued their studies.

***Tactics.*** Green slaadi are sentient spellcasters whose primary goal is to discover the key to metamorphosis into gray slaadi, so they're generally going to try to stay on the down-low. As long as they're in or near any inhabited area, they use their Shapechanger feature to assume inconspicuous humanoid forms, often those of their former hosts. However, their ability to assume a particular physical form isn't enough to fully conceal their true nature, so even if they look totally normal and respectable--possibly even attractive---their behavior will be glaringly, unmistakably weird. Only if their slaad-nature is discovered and called out will they resort to fighting.

Because green slaadi will be looking to stay hidden, they will often cultivate minions and followers to throw in the way of anyone looking to attack them. They will often compel that cannon fodder to attack first, using Hurl Flame from a distance, until such time that it becomes apparent that they need to get gone.

When a green slaad fights, its primary goal is not to kill its opponents but to escape. That being said, killing your pursuers is a reliable way of keeping them from pursuing you, and green slaadi, despite having Intelligence superior to other slaadi's, still aren't overly endowed with Wisdom. Also, note their innate ability to cast fireball and their Hurl Flame feature. A panicking green slaad will set lots and lots and lots of stuff on fire.

Let's evaluate each of its abilities with an eye toward how it can help the green slaad make its getaway (noting, first and foremost, the fact that it doesn't have proficiency in Stealth):

* Fireball drops the bomb on a sphere 40 feet in diameter--large enough, on average, to char four enemies, not to mention igniting all flammable objects in the area.
* Fear affects up to three enemies, on average (again, per DMG 249), causing them to drop whatever they're holding and run the other way if they fail their Wisdom saving throws. It requires concentration to sustain.
* Invisibility allows the green slaad to move unseen, though not to attack or cast spells while invisible. It also requires concentration.
* Detect magic has no bearing on the green slaad's ability to escape. Its application is in social interaction situations, in which the green slaad--always keen to learn anything that might help it metamorphose into a gray slaad--scans the PCs to O HAI I SEE YOU HAVE A MAGIC ITEM WITH MAGICAL PROPERTIES MAY I LOOK AT IT PRETTY PLEASE? Of course, social interaction with a green slaad is always going to be oddball at best, since many green slaad have not yet mastered Common, so unless a party member speaks Slaad, it will have to be conducted via either telepathy or gesticulation. Some green slaad have even gone so far as to will use telepathy on a minion, the minion claiming to be an "interpreter" for the hidden slaad.
* Detect thoughts is a useful early-warning system that the green slaad uses constantly to ascertain whether it's been found out.
* Mage hand, normally, is useful for picking up the teakettle without burning yourself. However, cast by a slaad, it becomes a micro-poltergeist that can slam doors, use objects that are on fire to set other objects on fire, prod animals into stampeding in front of pursuers, yank guards' weapons out of their scabbards and keyrings off their belts, throw cabbages (not to cause any damage, but simply because throwing cabbages is hilarious) and engage in all sorts of other mischief that doesn't involve lifting or pushing more than 10 pounds of weight.
* The green slaad's Multiattack can consist of two uses of Hurl Flame, two staff attacks (in humanoid form), two staff attacks plus a bite (in slaad form) or two claw attacks plus a bite (in slaad form). The melee attacks have a better chance of hitting than the Hurl Flame attack, although as DM you can rule that a Hurl Flame attack that misses its target hits something else and sets it on fire. To account for the difference in attack modifiers, we'll apply a 77 percent multiplier to Hurl Flame's damage for the sake of comparison (based on to-hit probabilities vs. target AC 15). Thus, two Hurl Flames = 16 hp damage, two staff attacks = 22 hp damage, staff/staff/bite = 33 hp damage, and claw/claw/bite = 26 hp damage. This tells us that, when mayhem ensues, the green slaad would prefer to revert to its slaad form rather than stay in its humanoid disguise. (Unless, of course, it wants to continue to masquerade as humanoid and throw more minions at the PCs.)

5e D&D bases its combat-balancing decisions on the assumption that combat encounters last three rounds, but to take down a green slaad that quickly, PCs will have to be capable of dealing a combined 49 hp of damage per round (thanks to its Regeneration feature), more than that if they're relying on magic to deal the damage. Even so, spending one turn to revert to slaad form will cost the green slaad precious time, during which the PCs can deal it quite a bit of harm.

So it won't do it the simple way. And anyway, why would a slaad do anything the simple way?

The first thing a busted slaad does is turn invisible. The next thing it does is revert to slaad form, which it can do without becoming visible, because changing shape is neither an attack nor a spell. Then it attacks. Or maybe it doesn't even attack. Maybe it just runs away, still invisible. It can keep that spell going for a full hour, after all.

But maybe the PCs have means of detecting or tracking an invisible opponent. If the green slaad observes that it's being pursued despite being invisible, then it drops fireball and fear on its pursuers, the former while still invisible (thereby rendering it visible to all). It doesn't stop fleeing, although while it's using these actions to disrupt pursuit, it can't also Dash. If the environment contains enough loose and/or flammable objects that it can use to cause further mayhem, it may spend actions on mage hand or Hurl Flame, but most likely, once it's used fireball and fear, it will simply Dash until it escapes or is cornered. If cornered, it will fight with its staff and bite, using invisibility a second time if an escape path presents itself. Given a choice between fleeing and fighting, it will always prefer to flee.

## Brown Slaad
The brown slaad are slaad that are infused with chaos and earth, born when a green slaad transforms not into a gray, but into something born of rock and stone. Like the gray, brown can only ascend to become death slaadi by consuming the corpse of a death slaadi, so like the gray, brown slaadi choose a death slaad to serve in exchange for the opportunity to become a death slaadi. However, some brown slaadi can also ascend by consuming one of their cousin-kin (the orange, indigo, or cyan), though it's not consistent as to when or how.

In their normal form, brown slaadi are ...

Brown slaadi are some of the least chaotic slaadi in their temperament and actions, but when they act, they often do so determinedly and unwaveringly, heedless of the outcome. Browns are often desirable to death slaadi as underlings, as they will resolutely carry out whatever mission they are assigned, but often they lack creativity to work around obstacles--they'd rather plow right through them.

***TODO.*** Much work remains to be done on this one.

## Cyan Slaad
The cyan slaad are slaad that are infused with essence of elemental Water, born when a green slaad transforms not into a gray, but into something born of sea and ocean.

## Indigo Slaad
The indigo slaad are slaad that are infused with essence of elemental Air, born when a green slaad transforms not into a gray, but into something born of wind. Like the gray, indigo can only ascend to become death slaadi by consuming the corpse of a death slaadi, so like the gray, indigo slaadi choose a death slaad to serve in exchange for the opportunity to become a death slaadi. However, some indigo slaadi can also ascend by consuming one of their cousin-kin (the orange, brown, or cyan), though it's not consistent as to when or how.

In their normal form, indigo slaadi are ...

## Orange Slaad

## Gray Slaad
Outside of Limbo, gray slaadi act as living extensions of the will of their masters, the death slaadi. A gray slaad journeys to the Material Plane on errands of doom, often taking humanoid form. A gray slaad learns how to master the use of a greatsword and imbue it with its own innate magic.

![](Slaad-Gray.png)

A gray slaad that eats the entire corpse of a dead death slaad instantly transforms into a death slaad. For this reason, many recently-transformed grays will seek out a death slaad and offer its services to the death slaad, providing useful service to the death slaad while looking for opportunities to betray its master and consume the corpse. (Naturally, death slaad, having been through this themselves, are fully aware of the nature of the relationship, and are constantly on guard against such betrayals.)

***Tactics.*** Gray slaadi have reached the pinnacle of their "natural" metamorphosis and relish fighting. In fact, they're usually on the prime material plane in the first place on some specific mission of mayhem. They can cast invisibility at will, but rather than use it to escape, they'll use it to approach enemies and get the jump on them. Although they natively speak only Slaad, they can use tongues to disguise their inability to speak the PCs' language(s). Their emergency exit, if somehow the PCs manage to seriously injure them (reduce them to 50 hp or fewer), is plane shift. But even gray slaadi have low Wisdom, and their choice of targets will be more or less random, unless they're on a mission to attack one or more specific people.

Gray slaadi probably won't bother to use fear against enemies they mean to fight, only against bystanders who get in the way of whatever mission they may be on. They can cast major image at will, and this can be useful for creating distractions during chases or even entirely fake personae for them to interact with the PCs through. A gray slaad may disguise itself as a VIP and conjure up a major image of a bodyguard or adviser--or vice versa! For super-duper mayhem during combat, gray slaadi can cast fly, gaining a flying speed of 60 feet and allowing them to swoop in to attack twice with their greatswords and once with their bite, then soar back into the air, out of reach of melee attacks. (With AC 18, they're indifferent to opportunity attacks.) And, of course, they still have good ol' fireball, only unlike green slaadi, they can cast it twice per day.

In general, having higher Strength and Dexterity than Constitution (though all three are very high), they will favor skirmishing and dealing large amounts of damage in single hits over staying in one place and fighting toe-to-toe. As long as they have their greatswords, they'll favor these over their claws.

## Death Slaad
Death slaadi are suffused with energy from the Negative Energy Plane and exemplify evil's corruption of chaos; thus, they take sadistic pleasure in bringing harm to others. They propagate their race by dragooning mobs of red and blue slaadi and invading other planes. Humanoids who survive the incursion become incubators for new slaadi.

![](Slaad-Death.png)

Some death slaadi are ancient and calculating, building pockets of Limbo as their own demesnes, from which they launch assaults and invasions into other worlds and planes. They will enter alliances with other beings if it serves their purpose, and will often keep the alliance so long as it continues to benefit them--but inevitably at some point, their chaotic nature will assert itself and they will betray their allies.

Often death slaadi will preface an invasion by carefully seeding green slaadi into a region, quietly seeking out spellcasters, infesting them, incubating the tadpoles until they are hatched as green slaadi and repeating the process. Some death slaadi will put themselves at the center of the infestation while others put a gray slaad in charge of the "local" operation. Generally the greater the magical concentration in a given region, the more attention it will draw from a death slaadi--and in fact, death slaadi have been known to fight each other over such regions.

***Tactics.*** Despite being able to shapechange, by the time a slaadi has reached this stage of its evolution, it is often tired of hiding its truenature. As a result, many death slaadi will openly move around in their natural form, unless and until there is particular call to do otherwise. They will, however, surround themselves with minions--gray slaadi lieutenants, green slaadi agents, and hordes of blue and red slaadi, as well as "lesser minions" (such as humanoids) captured on raids or kept as breeding stock, most of which serve the death slaadi in exchange for not being used as breeding stock. Some death slaadi are even rumored to have quite civilized domains (by slaadi standards), allowing their humanoid cattle to study magic, so as to create green slaadi, rather than red or blue.

Death slaadi don't bother with skirmishing--they're brutes. When they cast fly, they do it to close quickly with an enemy they want to pound the stuffing out of. They also have a bizarrely high Charisma for being hideous, spiky salamander people from a chaos plane. This is to help them blend in better while Shapechanged into humanoid form, making them still weird, but... *intriguingly* weird, sometimes even *ompellingly* weird.

In addition to all the powers of the gray slaad, death slaadi have one daily use of cloudkill. There's a difference between how they use fireball and how they use cloudkill: Fireball is for causing mayhem and, incidentally, doing damage to pesky PCs getting in the death slaad's way. Cloudkill is specifically for killing people the death slaad wants to kill.

Like gray slaadi, death slaadi will prefer to use their greatswords rather than their claws in melee combat, and they'll prefer to fight in their slaad form rather than their humanoid form, in order to include biting in their Multiattack. They'll retreat when seriously injured (reduced to 68 hp or fewer), using plane shift to escape.

Alone among slaadi, death slaadi are canny enough to be able to guess at PCs' alignments, and they'll zero in on lawful characters. After defeating one, they'll move on to another lawful character, who may not necessarily be the nearest. If and when all lawful opponents have been defeated, only then will they move on to other PCs, choosing targets largely at random.

## White Slaad
If a [death slaad](#death-slaad) journeys to the Ethereal and remains there for long enough, it begins a slow transition of color to white. At some point, the transition suddenly catalyzes the death slaad into a white slaad.

The white slaadi are also known as the chronos slaadi, due to their chaotic interference of time itself, which not only allows it to call forth itself from another point in its timeline, but gives it an uncanny awareness of events just before they occur. This ability to affect time has the effect of making the white slaad distant and unpredictable, even for slaadi.

The white slaad are obsessed with spreading chaos, seeding disruption where it will have the maximum effect, spreading and spreading far beyond the original act.

Many white slaad believe that the Spawning Stone was not created by Primus, but rather that the eldest slaad masters, Ygorl and Ssendam created it to impose structure on the creation of new slaad, to prevent the possibility that the chaos of Limbo might one day create a slaad more powerful than themselves. For this reason, white slaad and the slaad lords are often opposed in purpose.

## Black Slaad
Save for the great slaad masters themselves, no beings embody the raw destructive power of chaos like black slaadi. Beings of pure entropy, black slaadi appear as a toad-shaped blot of utter darkness from which its two diamond eyes gleam. It is not clear how black slaadi come into being, but it is rumored that death slaadi are transformed into black slaadi only by the will of the Slaad Lords.

Black slaadi are an enigma, for little has been written on these vastly powerful beings. They wander the Maelstrom, pursuing inscrutable goals and spreading wanton destruction for ends that make sense only in their insane minds. A handful of black slaadi serve as emissaries for the great slaad masters, but most are too devoted to chaos to bend the knee to another being. Many will cultivate slaadi minions, but often black slaad are too chaotic and entropic to hold on to any structure for long, and often wander off on their own, leaving white and death slaadi to battle for control of what they have abandoned.

If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.
>
>***Entropic Spit (Slaad Form Only).*** The slaad exhales mucus in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage plus, 14 (4d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
>
>***Magic Breaker.*** The slaad touches one magical object it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the slaad's touch. If the object touched is magical armor, a magical shield being worn or carried, or a magical weapon, it takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the bonus it offers. Items reduced to a magical bonus of +0 are destroyed. If the magical item targeted never offered a magical bonus it is unaffected by this attack.
>
>***Innate Spellcasting.*** The slaad's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 24). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
>* At will: circle of death, dimension door, greater invisibility (self only)
>* 3/day each: chain lightning, finger of death, maddening darkness
>* 1/day each: planeshift, power word kill, power word pain
>
>#### Legendary Actions
>The slaad can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The slaad regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
>***Entropy.*** The slaad blasts a wave of elemental chaos in a 10 foot circle. Any hostile creature in the radius takes 10 damage of one of the following types (slaads choice): acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, or thunder.
>
