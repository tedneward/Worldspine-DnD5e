## Abomination
An abomination, like a [Flesh golem](Golem-Flesh.md), is a grisly assortment of humanoid body parts stitched and bolted together into a muscled brute imbued with formidable strength. Its brain is capable of simple reason, though its thoughts are no more sophisticated than those of a young child. The abomination's muscle tissue is imbued with necrotic power, invigorating the creature with vitality and strength. Powerful enchantments protect the abomination's skin, deflecting spells and all but the most potent weapons.

An abomination lurches with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body. Its undead binding isn't always perfect, which causes the abomination to sometimes howl incoherently to vent its outrage. If the spirit breaks free of its creator's will, the abomination goes berserk until calmed, or until its shell of flesh is destroyed or completely healed.

>***Berserk.*** Whenever the abomination starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the abomination goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the abomination attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the abomination attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the abomination goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

>The abomination's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk abomination, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The abomination must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, or an ability check with the creator's spellcasting ability, at the creator's choice. If the check succeeds, the abomination ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the abomination might go berserk again.
