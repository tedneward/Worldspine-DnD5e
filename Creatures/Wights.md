# Wights
The word "wight" meant "person" in days of yore, but the name now refers to evil undead who were once mortals driven by dark desire and great vanity. When death stills such a creature's heart and snuffs its living breath, its spirit cries out to the demon lord Orcus or some vile god of the underworld for a reprieve: undeath in return for eternal war on the living. If a dark power answers the call, the spirit is granted undeath so that it can pursue its own malevolent agenda.

Wights possess the memories and drives of their formerly living selves. They will heed the call of whatever dark entity transformed them into undead, swearing oaths to appease their new lord while retaining their autonomy. Never tiring, a wight can pursue its goals relentlessly and without distraction.

***Life Eaters.*** Neither dead nor alive, a wight exists in a transitional state between one world and the next. The bright spark it possessed in life is gone, and in its place is a yearning to consume that spark in all living things. When a wight attacks, this life essence glows like white-hot embers to its dark eyes, and the wight's cold touch can drain the spark through flesh, clothing, and armor.

***Shadow of the Grave.*** Wights flee from the world by day, away from the light of the sun, which they hate. They retreat to barrow mounds, crypts, and tombs where they dwell. Their lairs are silent, desolate places, surrounded by dead plants, noticeably blackened, and avoided by bird and beast.

Humanoids slain by a wight can rise as zombies under its control. Motivated by hunger for living souls and driven by the same desire for power that awakened them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are able to plan but seldom do so, relying on their hunger for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands before them.

***Undead Nature.*** A wight doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Wight King
Wight kings, also known as skeleton lords are incredibly powerful undead warriors, almost as hard to destroy as vampires. Suffused with dark magic, a wight king's weapons shimmer with baleful energy. The merest touch of their spear tip or blade can drain the life from their foes, or slice through flesh and bone with an ease that is frightening to behold. Clad in ancient armour, their flesh all but withered away, there is little for an adversary to slash or stab. Even to stand before one of these skeletal warriors of antiquity takes a great effort of will. For these reasons, a vampire, a lich or a death knight will often charge a wight king with carrying forth the undead general's personal banner. Such a duty is often integral to the army's stability, and these indomitable undead warriors are able to hold aloft the army standard whilst tirelessly striking down one foe after another.

Over the millennnia, many a barrow of an ancient warrior-king has been violated by dark spirits or necromantic magic. The corpses of these once-mighty warriors are given unlife and part of their souls ripped back from eternity to provide an echo of their former minds. The only way to undo this foul sacrilege is to destroy the animated form and release the soul fragment back to eternity. Until this is accomplished, the wight king walks the earth as a powerful and destructive undead warrior.

Wight kings possess the memories and drives of their formerly living selves but polluted to evil and twisted by anguished jealousy against all who still live and breathe. Victims drained of life by the touch of a wight king rise again as normal wights under the wight king's command. Any zombies created by these wights come under the control of the wight king. In this way a wight king can gather himself a considerable army of undead.
