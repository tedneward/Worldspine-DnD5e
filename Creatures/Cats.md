## Lion
The lion is a pack animal, often a single male with several lionesses, who do the actual hunting for the pack. The alpha lion will permit other male lions within the pride only until the cubs are large enough to consider challenging him for the pride, at which point the alpha lion will drive away the other males. As a result, solitary lions are often aggressive when encountered, as they are either hungry and/or looking to establish their dominance.

## Greater Lion
Truly the king of the beasts, the greater lion often gathers other lions about itself as its pride. Cubs of greater lions are inevitably greater lions themselves, but many do not survive the battles of dominance within the pride.
