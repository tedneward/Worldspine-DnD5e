# Eladrin
Eladrin dwell in the verdant splendor of the Feywild. They are related to the elves found on the Material Plane. But while other elves can temper their wild impulses, eladrin are ruled by emotion--and due to their magical nature, they undergo physical changes to match their changes in temperament.

> Jump to: [Autumn Eladrin](Eladrin.md#autumn-eladrin) | [Spring Eladrin](Eladrin.md#spring-eladrin) | [Summer Eladrin](Eladrin.md#summer-eladrin) | [Winter Eladrin](Eladrin.md#winter-eladrin)

Eladrin have spent centuries in the Feywild, and most of them have become Fey creatures as a result--those presented here are of the Fey variety. Some are still Humanoid, however, similar in that respect to their other elven kin.

***Playable Race.*** The eladrin sometimes leave the Feywild and journey across Azgaarnoth as [adventurers](../Races/Elves/Fey.md), finding interesting stories and people along the way. Their connection to the Fey often leads them to pursue arcane careers, but just as many eladrin find themselves pulled in a more primal barbarian direction, or towards a divine calling as clerics, druids, or shamans, as they do wizardry or sorcery.

### Changeable Natures
The magic flowing through eladrin responds to their emotional state by transforming them into different seasonal aspects, with behaviors and abilities that change with their forms. Some eladrin might remain in a particular aspect for years, while others run through the emotional spectrum each week.

Whenever one of the eladrin presented here finishes a long rest, they can associate themself with a different season, provided they aren't incapacitated. When the eladrin makes this change, they use the stat block of the new season rather than their old stat block. Any damage the eladrin sustained in their previous form applies to the new form, as do any conditions or other ongoing effects affecting them.

## Autumn Eladrin
Eladrin often enter the autumn season when they are overcome by feelings of goodwill. In this aspect, they defuse conflicts and alleviate suffering by using their magic to relieve any ailments that afflict the people who come to them for aid. They tolerate no violence in their presence and move quickly to settle disputes, to ensure that peace continues to reign.
