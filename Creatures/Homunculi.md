# Homunculi
Homunculi are constructs bound to their creator by the act of artifice and arcane casting. Often used as a familiar by those who can construct them, homunculi are generally shaped in the image of their creator, but not always.

Homunculi are always bound to their creator (they die if the creator dies), and as such are never encountered randomly--they are always encountered while on a mission from their creator. Within certain mage schools, for example, homunculi commonly are used as messengers, and sometimes even as proxies during discussions or lectures. (Some wizards have put extra energy into giving their homunculi the ability to speak, allowing the wizard to remain in their rooms while sending the homunculi in their place to deliver a lecture or debate a topic. The wizard must maintain concentration upon the link with the homunculus to speak through them, however.)

## Homunculus
Shaping a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, and blood, [one can channel rare ritual magic](../Magic/Spells/create-homunculus.md) to create a faithful, squirrel-sized companion.

A homunculus is a construct that acts as an extension of its creator, with the two sharing thoughts, senses, and language through a mystical bond. A master can have only one homunculus at a time (attempts to create another one always fail), and when its master dies, the homunculus also dies.

***Shared Mind.*** A homunculus knows everything its creator knows, including all the languages the creator can speak and read. Likewise, everything the construct senses is known to its master, even over great distances, provided both are on the same plane. Functioning as a spy, a scout, an emissary, or a messenger, a homunculus is an invaluable servant for a spellcaster engaged in secret experimentation or adventuring.

These creatures are the result of an [Alchemist](../Classes/Artificer/Alchemist.md)'s work, and do not occur randomly in nature.

The Homunculus moves on the caster's turn, and some of its actions may require the caster's bonus action; see below.
