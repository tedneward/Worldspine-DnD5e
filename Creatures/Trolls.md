# Trolls
Trolls that are nearly obliterated but survive and regenerate from mere scraps of flesh can display bizarre features. Radically transformed trolls like the rot trolls, spirit trolls, and venom trolls that follow are especially likely to arise when trolls regenerate in the presence of magical emanations, planar energy, disease, or death on a vast scale, or if their bodies were damaged by elemental forces. These unusual forms can also be produced and shaped by the ritual magic of evil spellcasters or by trolls' own practices, as is the case for dire trolls.

***Vaprak the Destroyer.*** Although trolls are rarely devout and seldom ponder spiritual questions, some fear and venerate the entity known as Vaprak the Destroyer. Vaprak's true nature is something of a mystery, but Vaprak is always portrayed as a horrid, misshapen, greenish creature strongly resembling a troll. Vaprak is given to fits of mindless destruction and uncontrollably fears the plots and ambitions of other deities.Vaprak's troll worshipers believe this god devours the souls of those who have been cooked or digested (slain by fire or acid). Otherwise, the god spits the soul back into the world to regenerate a new body.

## Troll
Born with horrific appetites, trolls eat anything they can catch and devour. They have no society to speak of, but they do serve as mercenaries, particularly to the Hordish nations, but also to various third parties (particularly hags). As payment, trolls demand food and treasure. Trolls are difficult to control, however, doing as they please even when working with more powerful creatures.

![](Trolls.png)

***Regeneration.*** Smashing a troll's bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll's wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts can sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a troll's flesh. The trolls, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey.

***Troll Freaks.*** Their regenerative capabilities make trolls especially susceptible to mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A decapitated troll might grow two heads from the stump of its neck, while a troll that eats a fey creature might gain one or more of that creature's traits.

## Cave Troll
Ages ago a branch of trolls moved into the Underdark. Subterranean existence turned their bodies pale but also incredibly bulky and strong. Over time their intelligence degraded some but made them no less ravenous or cruel, while the strange energies of the Underdark weakened their regeneration but removed the vulnerabilities to acid or fire. Sadly (or, perhaps not so sadly), the Underdark energies also made them significantly vulnerable to direct sunlight.

Cave trolls can be found in small groups prowling the deep caverns of the Underdark (or sometimes closer to the surface, if they get lost and accidentally find exits into the open air), but more often they are found as guards in Underdark fortresses.

## Dire Troll
Trolls kill and eat almost anything--including, in rare cases, other trolls. This cannibalism has the effect of causing a troll to grow to an unusually large size. The resulting dire trolls crave more and more troll flesh to fuel their continued growth.

![](Trolls-Dire.png)

Dire trolls also increase their size by grafting flesh onto themselves. When a slab of quivering troll flesh is bound against a fresh wound on a dire troll, the dire troll's regenerative capacity incorporates the new mass into the troll's own musculature. Even more horrifying are the multiple arms, eyes, claws, and organs that dire trolls tear from their victims and graft onto themselves in this manner.

## Forest Troll
It is not known who (or what) ages ago crossed a troll with a treant, but the result was the forest troll, a creature with all the troll's "finer" characteristics and almost none of the treant's, save the treant's weakness to fire and its resemblance to forests. The slender body of a forest troll is triple the height of a human male, and covered in bark-like natural armor. Forest trolls lack some of the inherent cruelty and evil tendencies of their troll cousins (perhaps another benefit of the treant's ancestry), but they still have ferocious appetites and are violently territorial.

Forest trolls typically don't associate with other creatures, and stay close to their forest dens, where they feast on intruders who cannot quickly come up with an incentive for the troll to behave otherwise.

## Mountain Troll
Legends tell of a troll that stands 20 feet tall, vaguely giant-like in appearance, and lacking the traditional troll stupidity. These trolls keep to themselves in the mountain ranges in which they live, and legends suggest they are not as numerous, slower to reproduce, and only venture out when their appetite drives them to.

Legends also tell that when Yithi met one, their battle was punctuated by exchanges of wit and humor, until the two found themselves reluctant to actually hurt the other. That friendship, it is said, led to a secret pact between a village of mountain trolls and the Principality of Yithi, swearing friendship and mutual self-defense when necessary. Whether such stories are true, just the thought of dozens or more of these creatures on the battlefield is enough to make even the most bloodthirsty general think twice.

## River Troll
A river troll is a distinct and infamous breed of troll that lives almost exclusively within dirty rivers, marshes and other foul waters, hence their name. They have fish-like fins on their heads and back. A river troll somewhat resembles the bottom of the river, if that riverbed is particularly coated in sediment, slime, rotting vegetation, fish carcasses, and various other smelly detritus whose precise nature and origin are too horrible to contemplate. In all probability the river troll's stink is even worse than that of the riverbed, since one can add the troll's personal miasma to the ill-omened m�lange of odours emitted from the mucky smears on its skin. They often antagonize lizardfolk and any humanoid that gets too close to their river. River trolls are infamous for their rather disgusting ability of puking acidic bile on their enemies.

## Rot Troll
A troll infused with waves of necrotic energy as it regenerates can develop a symbiotic relationship with that deathly power. The troll's body withers, and the flesh falls away from the body as quickly as it forms. Eventually a rot troll becomes unable to regenerate, though the troll still heals normally. The creature courses with necrotic energy; simply standing near a rot troll exposes other creatures to lethal emanations.

## Spirit Troll
A troll blasted with psychic energy can take a nonphysical form upon regenerating. The troll's psyche survives, but the body is as insubstantial as shadow. The troll might be unaware of the transition--the creature still moves and attacks with teeth and claws as ever--but now the troll strikes at victims' minds.

## Stone Troll
The stone trolls are smaller and bulkier than the normal troll, but no less fierce. They tend to dwell near the outskirts of civilization, where they have learned passable Common and often wear some measure of clothing. They prey on travelers and their animals, before they are either slain or drafted into military service.

Scholars have noted that, over the centuries, stone trolls appear to be benefiting from their exposure to civilization, and many are now looking to join it, rather than eat it. Acceptance of a stone troll within civilized borders is not widespread, but several Yithi cities have small troll populations within them, and the trolls there are well-behaved and (if the stories are to be believed) productive members of society.

## Venom Troll
A troll that survives massive doses of poison might transform into a venom troll. Lingering poison infuses the troll's blood and tissue, and poison leaks from the pores to coat the troll's fangs and claws. These creatures are especially dangerous in close combat because poison drips off their flesh and sprays out from every wound they receive.

A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Troll Shaman
Troll shamans are trolls that support its brethren with spells to control the battlefield and tip the conflict in their favor. These trolls can also instill the fury and constitution of Vaprak temporarily in its allies, enabling them to fight with unnatural ferocity and regain hit points. Few trolls can calm their appetite enough to hear the call of Vaprak, which is fortunate for almost every other race on Azgaarnoth.
