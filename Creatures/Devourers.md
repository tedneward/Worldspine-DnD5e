# Devourers
A devourer resembles a walking brain protected by a crusty covering and set on bestial clawed legs. These foul aberrations feed on the brainpower of sentient creatures, taking over a victim's body on behalf of their mind flayer masters.

***Illithid Creations.*** Mind flayers breed devourers to serve as roaming hunters of the Underdark, creating an devourer by taking the brain of a thrall and subjecting it to a horrible ritual. As it sprouts legs, the brain becomes an intelligent predator as twisted and evil as its masters. In ways not yet known, these creations still retain some semblance to the thrall that begat them, and when the devourer reaches its "maturity", it is eager to consume the thoughts and feelings of prey by attacking [Intelligence](#intellect-devourer), [Wisdom](#will-devourer), or [Charisma](#charm-devourer).

***Deadly Puppet Masters.*** An devourer consumes a creature's mind and memories, then turns the host body into a puppet under its control. An devourer typically uses its puppet host to lure others into the domain of the mind flayers to be enthralled or consumed.

## Charm Devourer
A charm devourer is the bane of bards and sorcerers all over the Underdark, drawing away the magnetism and "presence" of its victims' charisma, until all that remains is a physical husk suitable as a shell.

By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round.

## Intellect Devourer
This strain of devourer focuses on the victims' knowledge and reason, draining their intellect. Once an intellect devourer enters a host, it seeks to maximize its time there, engaging in behaviors that protect its host for as long as it can. 

***Loyal Servants.*** Intellect devourers are the most loyal and subservient of the devourers, obeying commands of their illithid masters as best they can. This makes them the most desirable of the devourer strains, but also the most predictable.

## Will Devourer
A will devourer's focus is on the willpower and decision-making of the target, encouraging them to greater and greater heights of foolishness. Once they possess their target, they often engage in random and unpredictable behavior, usually in attempts to find new victims to possess.

***Random Servants.*** Illithids use will devourers to foment chaos and uncertainty among targeted communities, as the will devourer's activities once it has entered a host distracts from the more subtle machinations the 'flayers have in play.
