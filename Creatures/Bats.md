# Bats
The leathery-winged insect-eating "great to keep as a pet to keep away the mosquitos" kind all the way up to the "leave you with nightmares for the rest of your natural life" kind.

## Giant Bat
The giant bat is a fearsome sight to behold for most folk, and reports of vampires or dragons have often been tracked back to a giant bat nesting near a village or town. Generally unwilling to attack humanoids, the giant bat often looks to large rodents or insects for its meals, supplemented by the occasional domesticated pig or cow (if the cow is small enough).

### Environment
Forest, Ruins, Underdark, Conjured/Summoned

## Swarm of Bats
The swarm of bats presented here aren't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats (and rats) from the darkest corners of the night; even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.

### Environment
Forest, Ruins, Underdark, Conjured/Summoned
