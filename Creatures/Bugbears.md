# Bugbears
Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

***Goblinoids.*** Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, [hobgoblins](Hobgoblins.md) and [goblins](Goblins.md). Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.

***Followers of Hruggek.*** Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.

***Venal Ambushers.*** Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

***Playable Race: Specialists.*** Some bugbear tribes have begun to learn from the smaller ones around them how to [specialize and improve themselves](../Races/Bugbear.md), and have developed some startlingly good skills. The [Blood Ghost Berserker](#blood-ghost-berserker) tribe is one such tribe that has learned some of the primal paths of the barbarian, spread its knowledge to other tribes, and many bugbears now openly follow their ways. Bugbears also make excellent druids, rangers, and rogues, passably-good bards and clerics, and decent shamans, sorcerers, and warlocks. Most lack the dedication to pursue pale mastery or wizardry, though for some the benefits outweigh the work.

## Bugbear Chief
Many bugbear chiefs are simply the strongest or most brutal of the tribe, but as the bugbears have mellowed along with many of the rest of the Hordes, some chiefs are finding that simply bullying their way no longer holds much weight. As a result, many thoughtful and careful bugbears are finding their way into power, and slowly surprising many. Some bugbear chiefs even affect the behaviors of their less-evolved cousins, in order to gain an advantage, such as when negotiating trade rights with a merchant guild or a mercenary contract with nobility.

## Blood Ghost Berserker
The bugbear that follows the path of the Blood Ghost Beserker tribe is generally given a wide berth, as they have been known to rage at the smallest slights or perceptions. Though not all Blood Ghosts are evil, most are extremely chaotic, and their unpredictability makes others nervous and adds to the perception (and reputation) that they are evil.
