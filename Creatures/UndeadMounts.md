# Undead Mounts
The undead often take mounts for themselves, and these are often just as terrifying as their riders.

## Bog Unicorn
The bog unicorn is no ordinary undead creature. It is believed to be created through a dark and arcane ritual performed by a powerful necromancer. The ritual involves binding the spirit of a fallen warhorse to its decaying body while driving a sword through its head. This unholy process bestows upon the creature heightened endurance and grants it the ability to exist beyond the boundaries of death.

***Undead Mount.*** While the bog unicorn may inspire dread in the hearts of most, those who possess the ability to command the undead can harness its power as a mount. With its speed comparable to that of a horse, the bog unicorn becomes a formidable steed that carries its master through the treacherous marshes and into the depths of darkness.

***Negative Effects.*** As an undead creature, the bog unicorn bears the weight of its cursed existence. The foul energies that sustain it come with side effects. Those who ride upon its back may find themselves drained of vitality, experiencing a chilling cold that seeps into their bones. The proximity to death and the dark forces that surround the bog unicorn can have a corrupting influence on the minds of those who interact with it for prolonged periods.

***Undead Nature.*** A bog unicorn doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
