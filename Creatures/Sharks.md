# Sharks
Sharks are some of the most vicious predators of the sea, with normal sharks sometimes displaying a disheartening willingness to attack creatures larger than them (or not native to the sea). They are often the companions, familiars, or mounts for [Sahuagin](Sahuagin.md) tribes, particularly the larger varieties.
