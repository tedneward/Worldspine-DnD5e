# Zombies
A zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.

***Hideous Forms.*** Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.

***Mindless Soldiers.*** Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.

***Undead Nature.*** A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Psychic Zombie
In contrast with its slower, more-mindless cousin, the psychic zombie is a zombie that has been suffused with an evil psychic malevolence, making it a startlingly effective hunter. They are typically indistinguishable from the average zombie until they display a keener sense of intelligence or an ability that the average zombie would lack. They typically run in packs together, although some psychic zombies will gather other zombies around them and direct the pack.

## Zombie Knight
A reanimated knight, taken from their grave to serve a new master, as devoted in death as they were while alive. Zombie knights are more aware than ordinary zombies and may experience dim memories from their past lives, especially relating to battles they fought in. A zombie knight is often found leading a pack of lesser undead in a twisted parody of the soldiers they once commanded, though as strategy is almost lost to them, they fight unfeelingly and unrelentingly until destroyed.

### Environment
Arctic, Astral, Coastal, Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark, Underwater, Urban, Summoned/Conjured
