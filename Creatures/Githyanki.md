# Githyanki
Githyanki descend from an ancient people who were also the progenitors of githzerai (also in this book). These tall, gaunt folk have potent psionic powers and dwell, for the most part, on the Astral Plane. Among the best-known githyanki are the bellicose followers of the Lich Queen Vlaakith. They terrorize the Astral Plane, raiding into other planes to plunder the multiverse of its magic and riches.

***Followers of Gith.*** In their own language, githyanki means "followers of Gith." Under the guidance of Gith, the githyanki stratified into a militaristic society, with a strict caste system, dedicated to the ongoing fight against the victims and sworn enemies of their race. When their leader Gith perished, she was replaced by her undead adviser, Vlaakith. The lich-queen forbade worship of all beings except herself.

Of all their enemies, the githyanki most hate their former masters, the mind flayers. Their close kin, the githzerai, are second in their enmity. All other creatures are treated with simple contempt by the githyanki, whose xenophobic pride defines their view of inferior races.

***Silver Swords.*** In ancient times, gith knights created special weapons to combat their mind flayer masters. These silver swords channel the force of the wielder's will, dealing psychic as well as physical damage. A githyanki can't become a knight until it masters the singular discipline needed to will such a blade into existence. A silver sword is equivalent to a greatsword, and takes on the properties of a +3 greatsword in the hands of its creator.

In the eyes of the githyanki, each silver sword is a priceless relic and a work of art. Githyanki knights will hunt down and destroy any non-githyanki that dares to carry or wield a silver sword, reclaiming it for their people.

***Red Dragon Riders.*** In the uprising against the illithids, Gith sought allies. Her adviser Vlaakith appealed to Tiamat, the goddess of evil dragonkind, and Gith ventured into the Nine Hells to meet with her. Only Tiamat now knows what passed between them, but Vlaakith returned to the Astral Plane with the Dragon Queen's red dragon consort Ephelomon, who proclaimed that his kind would forever act as allies to the githyanki. Not all red dragons honor the alliance kindled so long ago, but most at least don't consider the githyanki their enemies.

***Outposts in the Mortal Realm.*** Since creatures that dwell on the Astral Plane don't age, the githyanki establish creches in remote areas of the Material Plane to raise their young. Doubling as military academies, these creches train young githyanki to harness their psychic and combat abilities. When a githyanki grows to adulthood and slays a mind flayer as part of a sacred rite of passage, it is permitted to rejoin its people on the Astral Plane.

***Astral Raiders.*** The githyanki despise all other races, undertaking devastating raids that take them from their strongholds in the Astral Plane to the far-flung corners of the multiverse. War is the ultimate expression of githyanki culture, and their pitiless black eyes know no mercy. After a raid, they leave shattered survivors enough food and resources to weakly endure. Later, the githyanki return to their conquered foes, plundering them again and again.

***Playable Race: Masters of Mind.*** [Githyanki](../Races/Gith.md) are a playable race by players interested in doing so. Githyanki gravitate towards martial and arcane, however both githyanki and githzerai races have shown they are equally facile in any class. While they are under no obligations to continue their ancestral hatred of the other side of their gith heritage, players should prepare a backstory that explains their particular reactions if they deviate from the norm. Note that gith are not common in Azgaarnoth, and as such they will often be mistaken for "Charisma-challenged elves".

## Githyanki Kith'rak
Militarized githyanki cultures assign ranks and responsibilities to citizens. Groups of ten warriors follow the commands of sarths (githyanki warriors; see the Monster Manual), while ten sarths obey the commands of a mighty kith'rak. These champions undergo torturous training and psionic testing until they can command the respect of their underlings.
