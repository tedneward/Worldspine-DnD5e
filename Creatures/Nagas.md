# Nagas
Nagas are intelligent serpents that inhabit the ruins of the past, amassing arcane treasures and knowledge.

> Jump to: [Bone Naga](Nagas.md#bone-naga) | [Guardian Naga](Nagas.md#guardian-naga) | [Spirit Naga](Nagas.md#spirit-naga)

It is said that the first nagas were created as immortal guardians by the Eldar, and when they Fell, the nagas deemed themselves the rightful inheritors of their masters' treasures and magical lore. Other legends tell that the naga's creators were, in fact, a different race than the Eldar. Industrious and driven, nagas occasionally venture out from their lairs to track down magic items or rare spellbooks.

Nagas never feel the ravages of time or succumb to sickness. Even if it is struck down, a naga's immortal spirit reforms in a new body in a matter of days, ready to continue its eternal work.

***Benevolent Dictators and Brutal Tyrants.*** A naga rules its domain with absolute authority. Whether it rules with compassion or by terrorizing its subjects, the naga believes itself the master of all other creatures that inhabit its domain.

***Rivalry.*** Nagas have a long-standing enmity with the yuan-ti, with each race seeing itself as the epitome of serpentine evolution. Though cooperation between them is rare, nagas and yuan-ti sometimes set aside their differences to work toward common objectives. However, yuan-ti always chafe under a naga's authority.

***Immortal Nature.*** A naga doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Bone Naga
In response to the long history of conflict between the yuan-ti and the nagas, yuan-ti created a necromantic ritual that could halt a naga's resurrection by transforming the living naga into a skeletal undead servitor. A bone naga retains only a few of the spells it knew in life.

## Guardian Naga
Wise and good, the beautiful guardian nagas protect sacred places and items of magical power from falling into evil hands. In their hidden redoubts, they research spells and hatch convoluted plots to thwart the evil designs of their enemies.

A guardian naga doesn't seek out violence, warning off intruders rather than attacking. Only if its foes persist does the naga attack, accosting enemies with its spells and poisonous spittle.

## Spirit Naga
Spirit nagas live in gloom and spitefulness, constantly plotting vengeance against creatures that have wronged them -- or that they believe have wronged them. Lairing in dismal caverns and ruins, they devote their time to developing new spells and enslaving the mortals with which they surround themselves. A spirit naga likes to charm its foes, drawing them close so that it can sink its poisonous fangs into their flesh.

### Environment
Ruins, Underdark
