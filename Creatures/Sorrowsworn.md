## Lost Sorrowsworn
The Shadowfell turns visitors around until they become marooned in its twisted landscape. Lost sorrowsworn--often referred to as the Lost--are representations of the anxiety and fear people experience when they can't find their way. These sorrowsworn appear desperate and panicked.
