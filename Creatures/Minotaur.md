## Minotaur
A minotaur's roar is a savage battle cry that most civilized creatures fear. When the Hordes descended upon Azgaarnoth, minotaurs were at the front of the lines, hewing through Firstborn and human alike with glee.

Over time, as more and more of the Hordish clans and tribes began to settle into Azgaarnothian territory, more and more of the minotaurs began to question the exercise and their presence within it: Was their purpose really to just die in battle so that orcs or hobgoblins could raise banners over blasted lands? Certainly, honor in battle was to be sought, but must it always be on others' terms? It is perhaps not surprising that it was minotaurs who started to look for ways to eke out different kinds of existence from the traditional Hordish ways, and that it was a minotaur that would eventually found the [Principality of Yithi](../Nations/Yithi.md).

Today, minotaurs can be found all over Azgaarnoth, often still working as individuals, and often still seeking honor and glory through battle and combat, but much of the time, they do so either to the ends of their employes (as part of a [mercenary company](../Organizations/MercCompanies/index.md)) or to the roar of the crowd (as a champion in a [dueling college](../Organizations/DuelingColleges/index.md)) or even with the sea spray in their hair as they chase down fleeing ships.

### Culture
When they first descended upon Azgaarnoth, minotaurs embraced the notion that the weak should perish and that the strong must rule—-and that they themselves are the strongest and most powerful race in Azgaarnoth. They believed their destiny was to rule the world, and that their dominion will be one of conquest and military might. 

Yithi, however, taught minotaurs that while they might be destined to rule, their path to dominion didn't have to lie through conquest and might--that, in fact, the "lesser" races were more likely to see the minotaurs as protectors if the minotaurs acted as protectors. Drawing upon minotaur sense of honor and glory, Yithi steadily turned his minotaur tribes from "conquerors" to "defenders" over his lifetime, and honing the notion of honor to a keen edge.

While many minotaur families and tribes in Yithi and Tragekia embrace Yithi's message, many of those who prefer the "old ways" find their perspective received well within the Ulmhorde, and periodically even within some of the tribes inside the more "civilized" nations.

Regardless of cultural outlook, all minotaurs see glory in battle. To that end, all minotaurs are trained in weapons, armor, and tactics from a young age. The minotaurs’ arrogance stems from a combination of strength, cunning, and intellect—-three virtues they hold dear, and which they deem the foundation of their greatness. They believe that this combination of traits is what sets them apart from their rivals.

### Honor Above All
For all their strength (and, sometimes, cruelty), minotaurs are bound by a powerful sense of honor. Each victory brings greater honor to both individual minotaurs and their families. Defeat invokes a stain that only death can fully wash away.

Honor demands that minotaurs keep their word once it is offered, and each minotaur remains faithful to friends and clan above all else. Minotaurs are often reluctant to befriend folk of other races, as they take such bonds very seriously, sometimes more than is reciprocated. If a minotaur does strike up a friendship, it is typically with other creatures that display the minotaurs’ virtues and sense of honor; to such friends, a minotaur becomes an ally whose support will never waver.

***Playable Race: Fear the Roar.*** [Minotaur](../Races/Minotaurs.md) characters often find that their strength and size lend well to martial classes, particularly barbarians or rangers; for the same reasons, they tend to shy away from roguish ones. Spell-minded minotaurs often find themselves drawn to clerical, druidic, sorcerous, or shamanic professions. Few minotaurs have the time and patience for artifice or wizardry. But minotaurs generally excel at whatever they put their hands to, and one of the favorite stories told around minotaur campfires is that of Kyri the Shadow, a minotaur whose mastery of the Way of Tranquility earned her not only a place among minotaur lore, but also Yithi's heart.
