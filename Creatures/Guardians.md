# Guardians
Wizards and other spellcasters create guardians for protection. A guardian treads beside its master, absorbing damage to keep its master alive as long as possible.

**Master's Amulet.** Every guardian has an amulet magically linked to it. A guardian can have only one corresponding amulet, and if that amulet is destroyed, the guardian is incapacitated until a replacement amulet is created. A guardian's amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn't being worn or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.

A guardian's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer. The amulet's wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.

**Magnificent Treasure.** Because a guardian's ownership can be transferred by giving its matching amulet to another creature, some wizards collect exorbitant sums from princes, nobles, and crime lords to create guardians for them. At the same time, a guardian makes a mighty prize for anyone who slays its master and claims its amulet.

**Construct Nature.** A guardian doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Shield Guardian
***Spell storage.*** A spellcaster can store a single spell within a shield guardian, which can then cast the spell on command or under specific conditions. Many a wizard has been rendered helpless by enemies, only to surprise those foes when its shield guardian unleashes potent magical power.

>***Regeneration.*** The shield guardian regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.
>
>***Spell Storing.*** A spellcaster who wears the shield guardian's amulet can cause the guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the wearer must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is stored within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.
