# Elves
Elves stand as the inheritors of the legacy of the Eldar, but owing to their long lifespans and slow reproductive rates, chose (more or less) to surrender this world into the hands of the humans that have slowly come to outnumber them. Elves have wandered to every corner of Azgaarnoth, and learned how to adapt to most environments, usually seeking to live in some semblance of harmony with the environment around them, including even the urban cities that humans invented/perfected.

Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Genetic Diversity.*** The elves proved to be the most genetically adaptable of the Firstborn, and as a result, were often found to most easily adapt to their surroundings in interesting (and genetically-sustainable) ways. In most cases, the subraces of the elves stem from the various tasks (and the loose castes that grew from them) given to them by the Eldar: the bright elves were the close personal servants of the Eldar, much as the high elves were their extended personal staff. The wood elves were those tasked with keeping the natural world in balance, even as the [*maerach*](Maerach.md) (Sea Elves) were given custodial duties of the seas, the [*avariel*](Avariel.md) (Winged Elves) the skies, and the [*eladrin*](Eladrin.md) (Fey Elves) ambassadors to the Fey.

Some of the elvish subraces emerged after the Fall, notably the *grugach*, who fled back into the wilds to escape the incessant conflict that accompanied the Fall, the [*drow*](Drow.md) (Dark Elves), who were (supposedly) at the heart of the Fall itself, or the [*shadar-kai*](Shadar-kai.md) (Shadow Elves), who somehow fell under the sway of the Shadowfell in a manner long since lost to history.

Practically speaking, elves themselves don't see as much difference between themselves in terms of subrace (with a few notable exceptions, in particular the *avariel* and the *maerach* thanks to their physical adaptations), but they are often still drawn to pair off and mate within their subrace simply because of proximity reasons. 

Elves have lost the incredible longevity of their ancestors, living only sightly longer lives than their present-day neighbors.

***Historic perspectives.*** Elvish personalities are as diverse as any other race, but most elves take a longer view of things and prefer to plan before acting; they often have a long sense of history and their connection to the world, and many elves know their ancestral history back several generations--which can stretch for up to thousands of years. For this reason, elves are often seen as lorekeepers and sources of wisdom and insight, which some use unscrupulously to their advantage. However, some (like the *eladrin*) embrace the chaotic nature of the world, believing that to try and predict nature is to go against nature. And thanks to the widespread interaction with most other races, elvish "long" perspectives are often challenged by others on a regular basis.

Elvish alignments span the entire gamut, though certain of the subraces have more marked tendencies in certain directions, as noted below. 

Generally, because elves are more prone to judge an individual by their actions than their genetic history, elves tend to maintain separate feelings about a race and individuals within that race. Thus, it is not uncommon to see an elf speak terrible things about the Hordes, while standing next to their orcish neighbor--whom they enjoy and would defend if attacked.

Among themselves, most elves find their judgements mixed. Bright and high elves, for the most part, have mixed and mingled for thousands of years, and only a comparison of history can really tell which are which. Wood and wild elves' distrust of those of urban upbringing includes other elves. Most surface elves (including the sea elves) are deeply distrustful of [their underdark cousins](Drow.md) and those elves who [embraced the Shadowfell](ShadarKai.md). They mourn those elves captured by the mind flayers millennia ago (that later became the [githyanki](Githyanki.md) and [githzerai](Githzerai.md)), but find the actions of those races today to be questionable at best.

Elves generally get along with [humans](Humans.md), have a long history of friendship with the [dwarves](Dwarves.md) and their kin ([gnomes](Gnomes.md) and [halflings](Halflings.md)), owing to their common heritage and history with the Eldar.

They have slightly cooler relationships with many of the Created--many [dragonborn](Dragonborn.md) they find uncomfortable or dispassionate, many [aasimari](Aasimari.md) seem too celestial, and [tieflings](Tieflings.md) are too reminscient of demons and devils to trust fully. Of the Created, elves get along best with the [genasi](Genasi.md), though their interests often diverge in surprising ways. 

Most elves are intrinsically prejudiced against the races of the Hordes, owing to the history of conflict dating back to the days of the Eldar, but the nature of many elves is such that, again, they tend to judge the individual on his/her own merits far more quickly.

***Playable Race: Grace and Strength.*** [Elves](../Races/Elves.md) are one of the staple races of legends and lore, and many elves have created distinguished names for themselves. While most see elves as noble warriors and arcane masters, just as many elves found in the shadows of roguish activity, or in monastary courtyards exercising discipline, or feeling the pull of primal barbarism.

### Elvish Names
Among bright and high elves, elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the twentieth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.

On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.

**Child Names:** Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall

**Male Adult Names:** Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis

**Female Adult Names:** Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia

**Family Names (Common Translations):** Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Naïlo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)

Wild elves typically don't bother with such ceremony, preferring to give a child a name at birth, and that child uses that name throughout its life. Wood elves feel similarly, though they will sometimes change names to demarcate a major life change (such as marriage, death of a spouse, coming into arcane power, loss of family, or other significant events).

## Wood Elf
Wood elves are those elves who live in tribes among the forests, typically in small villages and hamlets. They have keen senses and intuition, and their fleet feet carry them quickly and stealthily through their native forests. They do not fear or distrust civilization, but simply choose to engage with it sparingly, preferring instead to focus on care of their forests, woodcraft and other natural artifice, and defending the woods against trespassers.

Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.

## Wild Elf
The *grugach* are those elves who fled back into either barbarism or a closer connection to nature, depending on whom you ask. They have the deepest connection to nature of any of the elves (with possible exception of the eladrin, whose connection to the Feywild isn't always directly reflective of nature itself), and many wild elf tribes are found quite some distance away from civilization. It's not that they are too ignorant to understand civilization; it's that they don't trust it, and choose not to be a part of it.

## Tiri-Kitor Hunter
The Tiri-Kitor are a band of wild elves living in the grasslands around [Brinwal](../Cities/Brinwal.md). They have a deep connection to nature, and their Hunters rove the wide grasslands and marshes, keeping an eye out for trouble. They are often accompanied by animal companions--favored creatures being giant owls or giant crocodiles.
