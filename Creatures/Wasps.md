# Wasps
Typically, the wasp is of no threat, but its larger kin, or a lot of them, can be unnerving--and deadly.

## Swarm of Wasps
The swarms presented here aren't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.
