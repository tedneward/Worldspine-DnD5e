# Guardinals
From the mountains of Celestia, the lawful good angels reign supreme. Down in the depths of Carceri, the Nine Hells, and the Abyss, fiends fester in the dark corners of their forgotten planes. There are other beings of similar power elsewhere in the cosmos, but few as overlooked as the guardinal.

> Jump to: [Avoral](Guardinals.md#avoral) | [Cerdeval](Guardinals.md#cerdeval) | [Equinal](Guardinals.md#equinal) | [Leonal](Guardinals.md#leonal) | [Lupinal](Guardinals.md#lupinal) | [Musteval](Guardinals.md#musteval) | [Ursinal](Guardinals.md#ursinal)

These beings resemble humanoids with animal heads, which gives them a very distinct and disparate appearance. While there are many forms of guardinal, the most common ones were rodent-headed, goat-headed, wolf-headed, horse-headed, bird-headed, bear-headed, and feline-headed. It is rare to find a permanent city of guardinals. They have a tendency to wander a nomadic lifestyle alone, in pairs, or in small groups of friends. 

Guardinals are virtuous creatures, holding themselves above capricious acts such as lying, stealing, or cheating. This makes guardinals valuable peacekeepers to other beings of the outer planes. A guardinal will never lie, never cheat, never take a duplicitous path. All guardinals are about living in the moment, and just enjoying what is; not worrying about what might be, or being attached to what was. 

The guardinals live in the outer planes, centered on Elysium, although many can be found in the service of various deities. Like their angelic brethren, the guardinals can shrug off most spells cast upon them and are immune to many mundane woes like exhaustion. While the selection of magic available to each type of guardinal differs, they are all capable magic users and healers.

**Tranquility of Nature.** Guardinals love their home plane of Elysium for what it is; a picturesque image of nature in balance. To a mortal visiting their plane, it might remind them of a peaceful garden, or a quiet glade. Everything seems peaceful and safe, and that's the way the guardinals want to keep things. Should an invading force threaten to disturb this
tranquility, they should be prepared for the full might of the guardinals to fall upon their heads.

**Beings Of Goodness.** While angels are shards of divinity, splintered off and given form, the guardinals are long-lived mortal beings more like the eladrin. While they can be angered quickly, their defining trait is more about passion. Their passion for the lovely things in the world knows no bounds. Guardinals treasure things like well-brewed tea or conversation had during a sunset or a quiet walk on a beach. There's nothing better than a quiet happy sigh, to a guardinal.

**Adventure on the Horizon.** When not indulging in their home plane, guardinals feel the need to find work worthy of their lot. Devoting themselves to the various gods of the realms, whether wandering the outer planes looking for trouble or just going on a walk-about to see what they might find, guardinals are the natural adventurers of the universe.
Planar Creatures. Despite not being celestials, elementas or fiends, guardinals can be summoned using the planar ally or planar binding spells.

***Roleplay tips for guardinals:*** A guardinal should always be finding the silver lining in a situation. They're always smiling, enjoying themselves, whatever situation they find themselves in. They're fun and kind when treated as equals and with respect. However, any sign of an evil deed will have them as quick to act as a bulwark, placing themselves directly between that evil and its goals.

## Avoral
With unmatched eyesight, the avoral are the perfect scouts for the guardinals. Their great skill at flying, mixed with excellent spellcasting, make them revered wherever they go. Rarely found alone, those that are alone are typically on an important mission, otherwise, they're generally found in the company of other guardinals.

## Cerdeval
The ram-headed cerdeval are said to resemble satyrs, a statement they'll outright and flatly deny. Perhaps the differences are subtle, but it is more likely that of all the guardinals, the cerdeval have the most pride. Contrary to their powerful physical build, most cerdeval prefer to avoid conflict whenever possible through the use of their magic.

## Equinal
The most reserved of the guardinals, the equinal is a deadly warrior. Able to survive damage that would end lesser creatures, they spend most of their lives perfecting a specific art, honing it in the same way they would their martial prowess. Warrior poets, artists, and songwriters are common ways of life for an equinal.

The equinal gains temporary hit points equal to twice the number of creatures targeted (regardless of the outcome of their saving throw).

## Leonal
Leonals are charismatic, natural leaders, and paragons of bravery. The leonals are exceptional combatants, with powerful magic to back their natural weapons. When found with other guardinals, they take on a commanding role. When found alone, they're often in a self-exile, searching for meaning in the universe.

## Lupinal
The wolf-headed lupinal is an incomparable hunter; tracking down prey unerringly and quickly finishing them off. Lupinals very rarely congregate, with the sole exception of grand hunts. When a lupinal has found very difficult prey, they'll often seek out other lupinals to assist them.

## Ursinal
Second in strength only to the leonal, the fearsome presence of a ursinal was intimidating, but they were actually quite prone to encouraging others to nonviolence. Philosophers and academics, the ursinal kept the lore and history of the guardinals as living testaments to everything they were, are, or ever will be.
