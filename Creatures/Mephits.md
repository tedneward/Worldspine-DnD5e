# Mephits
Mephits are capricious, imp-like creatures native to the elemental planes. They come in six varieties, each one representing the mixture of two elements. Most mephits are the conjunction of two elemental essences and a longtime identity that chooses to continue its existence in a more corporeal form.

> Jump to: [Dust](Mephits.md#dust) | [Ice](Mephits.md#ice) | [Magma](Mephits.md#magma) | [Mud](Mephits.md#mud) | [Smoke](Mephits.md#smoke) | [Steam](Mephits.md#steam)

Ageless tricksters, mephits gather in large numbers on the Elemental Planes and in the Elemental Chaos. They also find their way to the Material Plane, where they prefer to dwell in places where their base elements are abundant. For example, a magma mephit is composed of earth and fire, and it favors volcanic lairs, while an ice mephit, which is composed of air and water, favors frigid locales.

Some scholars theorize that the mephit is the form punished souls take when disappointing a [Fiend patron](../Classes/Warlock/Fiend.md) or one of an elemental nature.

***Elemental Nature.*** A mephit doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
