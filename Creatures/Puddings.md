# Puddings
A relative of the ooze and the jelly, the pudding is an amorphous blob of semi-sentient "stuff" that typically lies in wait to ambush unsuspecting prey. They thrive in areas where few care to travel, only enough that they can be snared and subsumed without drawing too much attention. Puddings are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean space, free of any organic material, is a likely sign that a pudding lairs nearby.

***Slow Death.*** An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties are even large enough to engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.

Flesh, wood, metal, and bone dissolve when the pudding ebbs over them. Stone remains behind, wiped clean.

***Unwitting Servants.*** Although a pudding lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep puddings around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, a pudding can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade a pudding from leaving a particular tunnel or room.

***Spawn of Juiblex.*** According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, puddings, like oozes, are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control puddings and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, puddings have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.

***Ooze Nature.*** A pudding doesn't require sleep.

## Black Pudding
A black pudding resembles a heaving mound of sticky black sludge. In dim passageways, the pudding appears to be little more than a blot of shadow. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks. The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch.

## White Pudding
The white pudding is an offshoot of the black pudding, hiding in snow and ice until it can spring its trap against the unwary.
