## Poltergeist
A poltergeist is a different kind of specter -- the confused, invisible spirit of an individual with no sense of how he or she died. A poltergeist expresses its rage by hurling creatures and objects using the power of its shattered psyche.

***Undead Nature.*** A poltergeist doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
