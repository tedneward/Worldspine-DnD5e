## Giant Spider
To snare its prey, a giant spider spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims.

### Environment
Coastal, Desert, Forest, Hill, Mountain, Ruin, Underdark

If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
>
>***Web (Recharge 5–6).*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

## Giant Wolf Spider
Smaller than a giant spider, a giant wolf spider hunts prey across open ground or hides in a burrow or crevice, or in a hidden cavity beneath debris. They can be found almost anywhere in Azgaarnoth, though they particularly enjoy the crevices of the many ruins that litter the landscape. They can be particularly dangerous (and are quite numerous) in [Chidia](../Geography/Chidia.md), as half the continent is broken and rocky ground, and the other half city ruins. Legend says they are also quite plentiful in the [Underdark](../Geography/Underdark.md), so much so that the dwarves have legends of a spider goddess that seeks to prey on unwary dwarves who venture too far out from the hearth of the clan.

### Environment
Desert, Grassland, Ruins, Underdark

## Phase Spider
A phase spider possesses the magical ability to phase in and out of the Ethereal Plane. It seems to appear out of nowhere and quickly vanishes after attacking. Its movement on the Ethereal Plane before coming back to the Material Plane makes it seem like it can teleport.

Ethereal, Extraplanar, Ruins, Underdark

## Swarm of Spiders
The swarm presented here isn't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.

### Environment
Forest, Conjured/Summoned
