# Lycanthropes
One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.

> Jump to: [Wereape](Lycanthropes.md#wereape) | [Werebear](Lycanthropes.md#werebear) | [Wereboar](Lycanthropes.md#wereboar) | [Werecobra](Lycanthropes.md#werecobra) | [Wereagle](Lycanthropes.md#wereagle) | [Weregator](Lycanthropes.md#weregator) | [Werekraken](Lycanthropes.md#werekraken) | [Wereowl](Lycanthropes.md#wereowl) | [Wererat](Lycanthropes.md#wererat) | [Wereshark](Lycanthropes.md#wereshark) | [Werespider](Lycanthropes.md#werespider) | [Weretiger](Lycanthropes.md#weretiger) | [Wereturtle](Lycanthropes.md#wereturtle) | [Werewolf](Lycanthropes.md#werewolf)

Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns. Some lycanthropes seek out their own kind, only comfortable around those that suffer from their specific affliction, while others embrace any who share their curse. Rumors abound of whole villages of lycanthropes, somehow at peace with themselves and their surroundings.

***Curse of Lycanthropy.*** A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A remove curse spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.

A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form — or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.

Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.

***Humanoids and equipment.*** Lycanthropy can affect any humanoid creature so long as it is alive--that is to say, it has blood coursing through its veins and requires air, food, and water to survive. This means that many lycanthropes can have racial traits along with the abilities listed here; for example, a half-orc wereape might retain its Relentless Endurance trait. Similarly, many lycanthropes have found ways to adapt equipment to their unique physiology, and as such may have armor, shields, and magic items that they can use from either their humanoid or hybrid forms.

## Wereape
Wereapes are patient and careful creatures with mighty strength and toughness. They rarely infect those outside their family with their curse, to prevent disrupting the balance of wherever they live. They guard their territory, testing the mettle of outsiders to determine their worth.

Wereapes typically live in small family units nestled in remote jungles and forests where they live as foragers.

## Werebear
Werebears are powerful lycanthropes with the ability to temper their monstrous natures and reject their violent impulses. In humanoid form, they are large, muscular, and covered in hair matching the color of their ursine form's fur. A werebear is a loner by nature, fearing what might happen to innocent creatures around it when its bestial nature takes over.

When a werebear transforms, it grows to enormous size, lashing out with weapons or claws. It fights with the ferocity of a bear, though even in its bestial forms, it avoids biting so as to not pass on its curse. Typically, a werebear passes on its lycanthropy only to chosen companions or apprentices, spending the time that follows helping the new lycanthrope accept the curse in order to control it.

Solitary creatures, werebears act as wardens over their territory, protecting flora and fauna alike from humanoid or monstrous intrusion. Though most werebears are of good alignment, some are every bit as evil as other lycanthropes.

## Wereboar
Wereboars are ill-tempered and vulgar brutes. As humanoids, they are stocky and muscular, with short, stiff hair. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, they use heavy weapons, while in hybrid or animal form, they gain a devastating goring attack through which their curse is spread. A wereboar infects other creatures indiscriminately, relishing the fact that the more its victims resist the curse, the more savage and bestial they become.

Wereboars live in small family groups in remote forest areas, building ramshackle huts or dwelling in caves. They are suspicious of strangers but sometimes ally themselves with orcs.

## Werecobra
Werecobras are often sly and cunning, with personalities that are often regarded as strange and alien. They typically prefer not to pass on their curse, and typically hunt down and kill anyone they accidentally turn. Werecobras often live as spies, viziers, or assassins, staking social territories for themselves and staying away from areas that other werecobras have already secretly claimed.

Werecobras have a strange relationship to the [Yuan-ti](YuanTi.md); while some werecobras find the Yuan-Ti to be repulsive and seek either to stay far away from them or exterminate them, some find a strange kinship in their shared reptilian heritage, and often come to enjoy their company.

## Wereagle
Wereagles are a rare kind of lycanthrope whose curse is interwoven with divine magic. They are fierce and bold, with a tendency toward judging others harshly, but they greatly value freedom and helping others. A wereagle only deliberately passes on their lycanthropy once, as they feel the end of their life approaching. Wereagles often spend years in the mountains mentoring disciples for this purpose.

Wereagles often find a certain kinship and partnership among the [aarakocra](Aarakocra.md), and often find a home among their cities or nests.

## Weregator
A weregator is a ravenous predator with the huge jaws and tail of a crocodile or alligator. They are driven to act like wild beasts, lurking as barbarians in the wilderness even when hiding their true nature. A weregator's curse is powerful and maddening, leaving little of the person's original personality or mind intact. Weregators typically live and hunt alone in swamps, jungles, and sewers, although some come to find a home among [lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md), who will shelter and honor them, in exchange for serving as protection and/or muscle for the village. Strangely, the weregator curse appears to be vastly less common among lizardfolk; in game terms, lizardfolk have advantage on the lycanthropy curse saving throw.

## Werekraken
Werekrakens are ruthless and self-interested, with a vicious fury that is roused when they feel slighted or humiliated They use their tentacles to avoid passing on their curse, which they see as power that they own. Most werekrakens spend their days as privateers or pirate captains, granting their curse to their first mate but to few others among their crew, to prevent mutiny.

## Wereowl
Wereowls are a rare kind of lycanthrope whose curse is interwoven with arcane magic. They are inquisitive and awkward, with little talent or care for social interaction and an undying curiosity for all things magical. They do not concern themselves with whether they pass on their curse or not. Wereowls are typically found living alone as hermits in the wilderness, researching magic.

Given their deep attraction to arcane magic, it is not surprising how many find themselves drawn to the various Mage schools all across Azgaarnoth. Some wereowls are students, some are full members, and it is rumored that more than few head up a school directly; however, most wereowls prefer to keep their lycanthropic nature a secret from their arcane peers.

## Wererat
Wererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.

A wererat clan operates much like a thieves' guild, with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are accidentally cursed or break loose from the clan's control are quickly hunted down and killed.

Wererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These creatures are common in the sewers beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly found living among wererats.

## Wereshark
Weresharks are ferocious predators who stalk the seas and the coastlines near populated areas, eager to hunt other humanoids and devour them alive. They are often missing one or two limbs as a result of their encounter with the wereshark that first cursed them. They usually live alone as fishers or whalers when humanoid prey is sparse or when they need to throw off suspicion.

## Werespider
Werespiders are unintelligent and spiteful creatures as a result of their twisted curse, which poisons both mind and soul Some claim that their curse is touched by the will of the dark goddess Lolth. In their hybrid form, they grow two extra pairs of claw-like arms, and their faces transform into a twisted fusion of spider and humanoid, from which they can produce spiderlike webbing.

Werespiders usually survive in small swarms of up to a dozen at a time, building web-covered nests in caverns and dark forests, eating anything that stumbles inside. A small amount of victims are kept alive, wrapped in webs until their new lycanthropic curse takes hold of them.

## Weretiger
Weretigers are ferocious hunters and warriors with a haughty and fastidious nature. Lithe and sleekly muscular in humanoid form, they are taller than average and meticulously groomed. Weretigers grow to enormous size in animal and hybrid form, but they fight in their more refined humanoid form when they can. They don't like to pass on their curse, because every new weretiger means competition for territory and prey.

Weretigers live in jungles on the fringes of humanoid civilization, traveling to isolated settlements to trade or revel. They live and hunt alone or in small family groups.

## Wereturtle
A wereturtle is a rare kind of lycanthrope whose curse is interwoven with primal magic. They are solitary and reserved, careful to evaluate anything before making a judgment. Wereturtles almost never attempt to pass on their curse, only doing so when they find a land that is out of balance with nature and in need of protection.

Most wereturtles live as isolated hermits in the deep wilderness, guarding the environment against harm.

## Werewolf
In its humanoid form, a werewolf has heightened senses, a fiery temper, and a tendency to eat rare meat. Its wolf form is a fearsome predator, but its hybrid form is more terrifying by far — a furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a ravening wolf's head. A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its powerful claws and bite.

Most werewolves flee civilized lands not long after becoming afflicted. Those that reject the curse fear what will happen if they remain among their friends and family. Those that embrace the curse fear discovery and the consequences of their murderous acts. In the wild, werewolves form packs that also include wolves and dire wolves.
