# Wraiths
A wraith is malice incarnate, concentrated into an incorporeal form that seeks to quench all life. The creature is suffused with negative energy, and its mere passage through the world leaves nearby plants blackened and withered. Animals flee from its presence. Even small fires can be extinguished by the sucking oblivion of the wraith's horrifying existence.

***Vile Oblivion.*** When a mortal humanoid lives a debased life or enters into a fiendish pact, it consigns its soul to eternal damnation in the Lower Planes. However, sometimes the soul becomes so suffused with negative energy that it collapses in on itself and ceases to exist the instant before it can shuffle off to some horrible afterlife. When this occurs, the spirit becomes a soulless wraith â€” a malevolent void trapped on the plane where it died. Almost nothing of the wraith's former existence is preserved; in this new form, it exists only to annihilate other life.

***Bereft of Body.*** A wraith can move through solid creatures and objects as easily as a mortal creature moves through fog.

A wraith might retain a few memories of its mortal life as shadowy echoes. However, even the strongest events and emotions become little more than faint impressions, fleeting as half-remembered dreams. A wraith might pause to stare at something that fascinated it in life, or it might curb its wrath in acknowledgment of a past friendship. Such moments come rarely, however, because most wraiths despise what they were as a reminder of what they have become.

***Undead Commanders.*** A wraith can make an undead servant from the spirit of a humanoid creature that has recently suffered a violent death. Such a fragment of woe becomes a specter, spiteful of all that lives.

Wraiths sometimes rule the legions of the dead, plotting the doom of living creatures. When they emerge from their tombs to do battle, life and hope shrivel before them. Even if a wraith's armies are forced to retreat, the lands its forces occupied are so blasted and withered that those who live there often starve and die.

***Undead Nature.*** A wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Dread Wraith
A dread wraith is the dead soul of a once-mighty but particularly wicked ruler. After descending into the Lower Planes, it is saturated with negative energy by a fiend lord and sent back to the Material Plane. There it exists in a quasi-corporeal state with shadowy substance only sufficient to manipulate objects. Most wear dark robes over a breastplate and carry a rapier ensorcelled by their pollution until compelled to let them fall to the ground to escape physical restraint.

![](Wraiths-Dread.png)

Dread wraiths are unleashed to continue their bloody conquests in the name of a fiend lord or an incredibly powerful necromancer. Shadows of their former memories and personality remain to them, though driven now by a restless malevolence.

***Lord of the Dead.*** A dread wraith can create and attract armies of undead. Any undead within 1 mile can sense the presence of the dread wraith, and undead of CR 3 or lower are drawn toward the dread wraith and compelled to obey it.

## Demizen Wraith
Demizen wraiths, which look precisely like their non-demizen cousins, are powerful undead that take on the traits and actions of others to bolster their abilities. They feed off the necrotic energies of other undead around them, and in doing so gain the abilities of those upon which they feed, making them truly frightening creatures to face--sometimes worse than even mummies, liches, or vampires.

![](Wraiths-DemizenWraith.jpeg)

The creation of a demizen wraith is a deep mystery to mortals, though some necromancers have bragged of the knowledge.

>***Possession (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid that the wraith can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the wraith; the wraith then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The wraith now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The wraith can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the wraith ends it as a bonus action, or the wraith is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell.

The target is immune to this wraith's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

The wraith can have no more than seven specters under its control at one time.
>
>***Wail (1/Day).*** The wraith releases a mournful wail, provided that the wraith isn't in sunlight. This wail has no effect on constructs or undead. All other creatures within 30 feet of the wraith that can hear the wraith must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.
>
>***Replicate.*** As an action, the wraith can take on 1 trait or 1 action from an undead creature with 0 hit points within 5 feet of it. The wraith can have a maximum of Charisma modifier traits and Charisma modifier actions replicated in this way. All DCs gained from traits or actions are Charisma based. Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting can not be replicated.
>
>#### Bonus Actions
>***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the wraith takes the Hide action.
