# Lizards
Lizards are four-legged reptiles that often occupy swamps and marshlands, though plenty of others are more sun-dwelling/desert creatures, and still others are entirely subterranean.

## Giant Lizard
A giant lizard can be ridden or used as a draft animal. Lizardfolk also keep them as pets, and subterranean giant lizards are used as mounts and pack animals by drow, duergar, and other Underdark dwellers.

Some giant lizards have one or both of the following traits:

> ***Hold Breath.*** The lizard can hold its breath for 15 minutes.
>

(A lizard that has the Hold Breath trait also has a swimming speed of 30 feet.)

> ***Spider Climb.*** The lizard can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Greater Giant Lizard
Greater giant lizards are over 10 feet long and weigh around 400 pounds. Normally solitary hunters, their preferred tactic is to use their infectious maw to wound prey and then stalk it as it weakens over time. By tasting the air with their sensitive tongue, greater giant lizards can locate even concealed prey. Though they look slow and lumbering, they are capable of surprising quickness when necessary and can swim significant distances. These overlarge monitor lizards have been mistaken for a kind of "dragon" by isolated, primitive villagers.

Some greater giant lizards have one or both of the following traits:

> ***Hold Breath.*** The lizard can hold its breath for 15 minutes.
>

(A lizard that has the Hold Breath trait also has a swimming speed of 30 feet.)

> ***Spider Climb.*** The lizard can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

>***Keen Sense.*** The lizard has advantage on Wisdom (Perception, Survival) checks to detect or track a creature that doesn't have all its hit points.
>
>#### Actions
>***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target has the poisoned condition and can't regain hit points except by magical means. The target's hit point maximum decreases by 7 (2d6) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies.
