# Hags
Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.

***Faces of Evil.*** Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.

All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.

Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways, claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.

***Monstrous Motherhood.*** Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother's womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.

Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

***Dark Bargains.*** Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.

Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dear — especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.

***A Foul Nature.*** Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might "help" such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.

This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag's life. A hag might fly in a magical giant's skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.

***Dark Sorority.*** Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don't like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag's territory, bring gifts when entering another hag's dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags — as long as the oath isn't given with the fingers crossed.

Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags' rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

***Dark Lairs.*** Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag's lair reflects the creature's noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

### Hag Covens
When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos. The coven can be made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.

Any hag that is part of a coven has its CR boosted by 2 if encountered in its coven. Each hag in the coven has its CR adjusted this way.

While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they each gain the following action:

> ***Shared Spellcasting.*** The hag is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12 + the hag's Int modifier, +4 + the hag's Int modifier to hit with spell attacks). The three hags in the coven share the spell slots listed. The hag has the following wizard spells prepared:
>
>* *1st level (4 slots):* [identify](../../Magic/Spells/identify.md), [ray of sickness](../../Magic/Spells/ray-of-sickness.md)
>* *2nd level (3 slots):* [hold person](../../Magic/Spells/hold-person.md), [locate object](../../Magic/Spells/locate-object.md)
>* *3rd level (3 slots):* [bestow curse](../../Magic/Spells/bestow-curse.md), [counterspell](../../Magic/Spells/counterspell.md), [lightning bolt](../../Magic/Spells/lightning-bolt.md)
>* *4th level (3 slots):* [phantasmal killer](../../Magic/Spells/phantasmal-killer.md), [polymorph](../../Magic/Spells/polymorph.md)
>* *5th level (2 slots):* [contact other plane](../../Magic/Spells/contact-other-plane.md), [scrying](../../Magic/Spells/scrying.md)
>* *6th level (1 slot):* [eyebite](../../Magic/Spells/eyebite.md)

However, some covens gather for a specific purpose, such as collecting blood from rare magical bloodlines, summoning the souls of ancient heroes and villains, or polluting the land with vile toxins and noxious plagues. In such cases, since the coven strives to bend its magic to a more directed purpose, the coven members may have different spells available for use with their Shared Spellcasting trait, usually focusing on a theme related to that purpose.

**Blood** Some covens are fascinated by the dark power invested in the blood of fey, fiends, and even mortalkind, developing magic that uses the following spell list:

>* *1st level (4 slots):* blood reading, inflict wounds
>* *2nd level (3 slots):* carnage blast, infuse bloodt
>* *3rd level (3 slots):* blood extraction, life transference, vampiric touch
>* *4th level (3 slots):* aura of life, hemorrhage
>* *5th level (2 slots):* grim terror, hold monster
>* *6th level (1 slot):* essence sap

**Corruption.** Hags that, above all else, wish to see the world defiled, cursed, and blighted, form covens that use poisonous spell lists such as this one:

>* *1st level (4 slots):* bane, spasm
>* *2nd level (3 slots):* Rizzak's reeking filth, poison food or drink
>* *3rd level (3 slots):* bestow curse, plague vector, toxic breath
>* *4th level (3 slots):* blight, venom lash
>* *5th level (2 slots):* befoul water, grave soil 
>* *6th level (1 slot):* harm

**Greed.** Though most care little for mortal coin, some hags form covens for the purpose of collecting magical items, eldritch artifacts, or anything else the hags might so desperately desire, using the following spells:

>* *1st level (4 slots):* delude, identify, Tenser's floating disk
>* *2nd level (3 slots):* locate object, suggestion
>* *3rd level (3 slots):* excite emotions, mortify
>* *4th level (3 slots):* compulsion, Leomund's secret chest
>* *5th level (2 slots):* creation, geas
>* *6th level (1 slot):* forbiddance

**Madness.** Whether they are devoted to the spread of insanity or simply mad themselves, covens attuned to the touch of madness often have a spell list like this:

>* *1st level (4 slots):* delude, dissonant whispers, Tasha's hideous laughter
>* *2nd level (3 slots):* crown of madness, suggestion
>* *3rd level (3 slots):* fear, incite self-harm
>* *4th level (3 slots):* confusion, phantasmal killer
>* *5th level (2 slots):* dominate person, modify memory
>* *6th level (1 slot):* mass suggestion

**Souls.** When a coven tampers with the magic of souls and the afterlife itself seeking power, lost wisdom, and ghastly servants, they usually use the following spells:

>* *1st level (4 slots):* false life, unseen servant
>* *2nd level (3 slots):* gentle repose, locate animals or plants
>* *3rd level (3 slots):* revivify, speak with dead, spirit guardians
>* *4th level (3 slots):* create apparition, locate creature
>* *5th level (2 slots):* detect souls, spectral calling
>* *6th level (1 slot):* soul blade

**Trickery.** Hag covens organized around no purpose other than the delight they feel for wicked deceit often develop illusory magic and seek out spells like these:

>* *1st level (4 slots):* disguised blast, silent image
>* *2nd level (3 slots):* blur, mirror image, Nystul's magic aura
>* *3rd level (3 slots):* hypnotic pattern, major image
>* *4th level (3 slots):* greater invisibility, hallucinatory terrain
>* *5th level (2 slots):* mislead, seeming
>* *6th level (1 slot):* programmed illusion

**Twilight.** Hags that seek mastery over both light and darkness or those that seek to walk among dreams use an eerie witchlight and spell lists such as this one:

>* *1st level (4 slots):* faerie fire, sleep
>* *2nd level (3 slots):* darkness, moonbeam, silence
>* *3rd level (3 slots):* gaseous form, nondetection
>* *4th level (3 slots):* shadow of Moil, sickening radiance
>* *5th level (2 slots):* chilling darkness, dream
>* *6th level (1 slot):* eyebite

***Hag Eye.*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.

A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

## Annis Hag
Annis hags lair in mountains or hills. These hunchbacked and hump-shouldered hags are the largest and most physically imposing of their kind, standing eight feet tall. They can easily tear a fully grown person apart, but they love hunting the young, preferring their flesh above all others.

Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at the edges of forests and other areas they claim to provoke fear and distrust in nearby villages and settlements. To an annis hag, nothing is sweeter than making a once-vibrant community paralyzed with terror, so folk never venture out at night, strangers are met with suspicion and anger, and parents warn their children: "Be good, or the annis will get you."

When an annis feels especially cruel, the hag adopts the appearance of a kindly elder, approaches a child in a remote place, and gives them an iron token (described below), through which the child can magically confide in the hag. Over time, "Granny" or "Grampy" convinces the child that it's okay to do bad deeds--starting with breaking things or wandering without permission, then graduating to pushing someone down the stairs or setting a house on fire. Eventually, the child's terrified family and community face painful decisions of what to do about the seemingly remorseless child.

Much as annis hags befriend children in order to corrupt them, they may adopt a group of ogres, trolls, or other creatures (ogres and trolls appear in the Monster Manual), ruling them through brute strength, insults, and superstition.

***Iron Token.*** An annis hag can pull out one of their iron teeth or nails and spend 1 minute shaping and polishing it into the form of a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror. Thereafter, any creature that holds this iron token can have a whispered conversation with the hag, provided the creature and the hag are within 10 miles of each other. When the hag speaks through the token, the holder can hear the hag's whisper but not any other sounds at the hag's location. Similarly, the hag can hear the holder of the token but not the noise around it.

A hag can have up to three iron tokens active at one time. As an action, the hag can discern the direction and approximate distance to those active tokens. The hag can deactivate any of those tokens at any distance (no action required), whereupon the token retains its current form but loses its magic.

## Bheur Hag
Bheur hags live in wintry lands, favoring snowy mountains. These hags become more active during winter, using their ice and weather magic to make life miserable for nearby settlements.

A bheur hag's skin has the bluish hue of a person who has frozen to death. The hag's hair is white, and the hag is emaciated, with pale eyes surrounded by bruise-colored flesh. A bheur hag carries a twisted gray wooden staff that can be ridden like a flying broom and that augments the hag's magic.

Bheur hags are attracted to selfish actions inspired by deadly cold, such as murdering a traveler for a winter coat or chopping down a dryad's grove for firewood. These actions are especially sweet to a bheur if they are unwarranted, such as a greedy merchant hoarding excess food for the winter while others starve. Bheurs use their ability to manipulate weather to batter villages with freezing cold, hoping to instill a despair that turns folk against each other.

In combat, a bheur hag also strives to inspire horror. When near a recently slain foe, the hag may forgo an attack to feed on the corpse. The sight of this butchery is enough to terrify most witnesses.

Each creature of the hag's choice that is within 60 feet and able to see the feeding must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the hag for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Feast for the next 24 hours.

>

## Cinder Hag
Cinder hags can be found wherever temperatures are high, such as sun-baked deserts, steaming jungles and scorched plains. Cinder hags have coal-black skin and piercing red eyes, while their hair is a mixture of red and orange and occasionally moves on its own, such that it resembles a burning fire. A cinder hag often rubs her skin with ash and charcoal, though they prefer bone ash from intelligent creatures, humanoids in particular.

![](Hag-Cinder.png)

**Incendiary Fey**. Cinder hags have a grim fascination with watching things burn, though nothing pleases a cinder hag more than watching a humanoid settlement burn. Fire is essential to many crafts that settled people cannot live without, such as metalworking, but when fire grows uncontrolled, it is wild and destructive.

At the heart of every cinder hag's lair burns a great fire called a grimflame. While the hag lives, this fire cannot be extinguished by nonmagical means. Through the fire, she sees distant occurrences, and she can command it to rise at her order. A grimflame must be at least 10 feet high and 10 feet wide for the hag to use its magic. While the hag is within 10 feet of her grimflame, she can use an action to percieve anything happening within 1 mile of the grimflame, as if she had cast the [scrying](../Magic/Spells/scrying.md) spell.

Cinder hags often bind creatures of elemental fire into serving them. Most cinder hag lairs are infested with [magmin](Extraplanar/ElementalServants.md#magmin)s, while the most powerful of cinder hags bind [efreeti](Extraplanar/Genies.md#efreeti) into their service.

A cinder hag possesses the ability to teleport great distances, but only if her destination is near a large, open conflagration. When she does so, she leaves a faint cloud of foul-smelling smoke in her wake.

## Crimson Hag
The mad crimson hags are known for reveling in blood, fire, ashes, and destruction. More than anything, they enjoy starting fires that consume entire communities, especially if they can trick the inhabitants into being trapped within the conflagration. They often appear in the flames and smoke, cackling and taunting their helpless victims as they reveal their true ashen, gray form and their burning red eyes.

When they can't ignite an entire village or town, these hags settle for using their illusory disguises to frame others for arson and cause chaos that way. Crimson hags have just as much love for deception as other hags, and often pose as diviners that peer into mystical flames when enacting their schemes. Their most favorite trick is to be "captured" as a witch and burned at the stake, cackling madly as they turn the flames on their captors.

***Maddened By Terrors.*** The sight of fresh blood drives a crimson hag into a temporary state of madness. In this blood madness, the hag experiences hallucinations of horrors and terrors, shrieking things that test one's sanity, and visions from beyond By the time they are adults, crimson hags have been driven to a constant state of half-madness, and they no longer fear not only their own hallucinations, but anything at all These hags enjoy the rush they feel while in the blood madness, and eagerly scheme for their best opportunity to enter the state and enjoy the reckless sadism that it brings to the fullest before the blood madness ends.

***Self-Destructive Covens.*** There are many reasons why a coven of crimson hags, once established, rarely lasts very long. The most prominent is the hags' love for wanton destruction and especially their blood madness. In the throes of the madness, a crimson hag will often attack its own allies, including other crimson hags within the coven, if they are nearby. Of course, even without the blood madness, a crimson hag's love for ruin, destruction, and deception make schemes of betrayal and sabotage all the more enticing. However, this results in great collateral damage. When a powerful coven of crimson hags self-destructs, it can cause untold carnage, destruction, and death across the land.

She has advantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration or resist enchantment spells, she can't be charmed, and her speed is increased by 10 feet.

## Death Hag
When a night hag gathers over a hundred twisted souls, she can transform into a more powerful kind of fiendish hag known as a death hag. Death hags are much larger than night hags, towering over other kinds of hags at ten to eleven feet tall They have withered violet skin, fangs, and pointed ears. Some have twisted horns like those of a goat or ram, while others lose their horns in the transformation from night hag to death hag. Each one carries a huge scythe adorned with bones and skulls, enchanted with potent death magic, and can ride the scythe as if it were an enchanted flying broom. They ride their scythes invisibly through the dark of night, cackling and stealing corpses to use for their foul purposes.

***Twisting Good to Evil.*** Just as night hags often enjoy twisting a living soul from good to eviL death hags revel in their ability to twist the once-noble dead into undead paragons of evil Instead of returning the creature to life by retrieving their original soul, the hag fashions a dark mirror of their soul to inhabit the body in its place. 

This mirror shadow-soul has all the skills, memories, and personality of the original souL except that any pain, grudges, or unfinished business lingering from their life is twisted into the fuel for anger, hatred, and evil. Once risen, these creatures of good-turned-evil will seek out the ones who wronged them and enact their terrible vengeance. Even their once-loved ones become targets for their hatred, as the hag's magic twists the heartache at missing those loved ones into hatred and indignation.

Tragically, these risen champions will often turn to harming unrelated innocents in a misguided attempt to satisfy the endless pain inside them. The shadow soul believes itself to be the originaL and doesn't understand that the hag has twisted its emotions. The hag delights in watching all of this from afar. Her favorite outcome is when the tales of the champion's good deeds are finally replaced by the legends of the twisted, evil villain and their rampage of vengeance.

***Torment from Beyond.*** Death hags take pleasure in any pain caused by bringing the dead back from beyond the grave. The target of their revival doesn't need to be a good-hearted hero for the death hag to be amused. She also enjoys watching other anguishes unravel, such as raising a widow's lost husband after she has happily remarried, or returning a monarch after the new one has already been crowned to cause strife. Death hags will eagerly bargain to resurrect the lost loved ones of their victims without revealing the likely tragic outcome.

***Undead Allies.*** Death hags are capable of seizing control of weaker undead, and they use this power to surround themselves with undead minions such as ghouls, skeletons, specters, zombies, and even other hags (raised as withering hags). For undead that are too powerful to control through magic, such as liches or vampires, some of the more conniving death hags will make deals, arrangements, or even alliances to secure greater power. As with all hags, these bargains are
always secretly in the hag's favor.

***Covens.*** A death hag that is part of a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the Monster Manual) has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP).

>***Corrupting Revival.*** When the hag casts a spell to bring a creature back to life, the target doesn't have to be willing, and unless the soul is in the hag's reaping scythe and she chooses to use it, the spell doesn't return the target's soul, instead creating a dark shadow to replace it: the creature returns to life with its alignment changed to evil, either lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil (based on its original alignment), and it counts as an undead in addition to its other types. These changes last until it dies again.
>
>***Reaping Scythe.*** The hag carries a reaping scythe, a magical scythe that serves as a conduit between the worlds of the living and the dead. She can ride the scythe as if it were a broom of flying, although she cannot attack with it while doing so. While she holds the scythe, other creatures within 30 feet of her can't regain hit points unless she allows it. If the scythe is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a day and can only be done in Hades. Only a death hag can use a reaping scythe.
>
>#### Actions
>***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
>
>* *At will:* feign death, gentle repose, ray of sickness (as 5th level), speak with dead
>* *3/day each:* animate dead, plane shift (self only), raise dead
>* *1/day each:* create undead, resurrection
>
>***Multiattack.*** The hag makes three claw attacks, or one claw attack and one reaping scythe attack.
>
>***Claw (Hag Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage
plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
>
>***Reaping Scythe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 36
(8d8) necrotic damage. If the target is not an undead or construct, the hag regains hit points equal one-third of the necrotic damage dealt, and if the attack kills such a target, the target's soul is stolen by the scythe. A creature whose
soul is stolen can't be brought back to life until the scythe is destroyed, except by a death hag holding the scythe.
>
>***Invisible Passage.*** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.
>
>***Change Shape.*** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. The only equipment that is transformed is her reaping scythe, which shrinks so that it can be wielded in humanoid form. If she dies, she reverts to her true form, and the reaping scythe reverts to its normal size.
>
>***Control Undead (3/Day).*** One undead that the hag can see within 30 feet of her must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the hag's commands for the next 24 hours. On a success, the target is immune to the hag's control for the next 24 hours. An undead whose challenge rating or level is greater than 5 is always immune to this effect.

## Desert Hag
![](Hag-Desert.png) | Tan hunched, emaciated, and sun-shriveled, the desert hags tread slowly and steadily across the dunes searching for lost travelers to entice and devour. If the target is well-provisioned, the hag uses her powers of illusion to appear as a lost and beautiful traveler in dire need of assistance. If the target is in need, she uses her abilities to appear as a beautiful traveler awaiting them in a secluded oasis. Her goal is to use her magical kiss upon her victim, charming them and luring them back to her lair to be devoured in safety.

***Person Jerky.*** Desert hags often roam the desert in long and winding journeys, so they often dry and salt the meat of their victims, making jerky and other cured meats out of the hapless humanoids that they encounter and consume. They carry some of this dried meat with them on their journeys, sustaining themselves with it when prey is too sparse or dangerous.

***Mirage Weavers.*** Desert hags use their powers of illusion to weave detailed mirages over the landscape, disguising their lairs as something less frightening or creating the right desert backdrop to enact their deceptions in. They take great pride in the efficacy of these mirages, and can be thrown into a rage if her illusory weaving is insulted or belittled.

A creature kissed in this way must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the hag for 1 hour, with the same effects as a [charm person](../Magic/Spells/charm-person.md) spell. While a creature is charmed by this ability, it sees an illusion of the hag made beautiful instead of her true form, and believes the true form of the hag seen by others to be the illusion.

## Eldritch Hag
On the rare occasions when a hag becomes lost in the Far Realm, the strange energies of that realm transform her into an aberrant hag known as an eldritch hag. Her skin turns pale and slimy, her claws become webbed, she gains gills, and she grows three to five tentacles out of her back. She loses her eyes, but it doesn't stop her from seeing, and her victims may still feel her eerie gaze upon them, and even meet her sightless gaze somehow. With just a look, she can inspire madness and warp a creature's body with strange Far Realm energies.

Eldritch hags always return to the Material Plane or the Feywild in time, and when they do they search for a place near water to make their lair, usually at the edges of coastal cities and villages. Eldritch hags feel a natural compulsion to open the Far Realm to the planes and let the denizens of that other world flood into this one. 

***Thief of Memories.*** An eldritch hag can consume the memories from inside a person's own mind When she does, she can replace the devoured memories with new fake memories. The new memories may be completely different from the originals, or they could be eerily similar with a few small but important alterations. The hag relishes the taste of real memories, and she enjoys the sadistic harm she can cause with the fake memories. An eldritch hag will often amuse herself by slowly altering a victim's entire identity or causing everyone they know to entirely forget who they are.

***Hatred of Magic.*** Eldritch hags despise all non-psionic magic, and this hatred influences their choice of victims. Anyone with any magical power, talent, or learning is in danger when an eldritch hag is near. She loves to make spellcasters hurt, and she finds no child more delectable than one with magical power.

While their hatred of magic causes eldritch hags to loath most other kinds of hags, eldritch hags consider riddle hags to be their greatest nemeses above all. 

***Illithid Intrigue.*** Eldritch hags and illithids often find reason to work together, but the two factions rarely trust each other. The illithids use these Far Realm hags as mercenaries to be employed against their more magical enemies, and the hags use the illithids to gain access to new victims and new sources of power.

When these arrangements fall apart, the eldritch hag can seriously threaten even the more powerful colonies of illithids. The hag's ability to reshape memories can be a problem even for mind flayers. Hags that work with a colony of mind flayers always have at least a few tricks in their back pocket for when the illithids decide she is no longer worth the threat she poses. Most commonly, she may try to elevate a challenger within the ranks of the colony, splitting the illithids in a civil war and coup backed by the hag herself.

***Covens.*** An eldritch hag that is part of a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the Monster Manual) has a challenge rating of 10 (5,900 XP).

The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or else take 21 (6d6) psychic damage plus 21 (6d6) force damage and become confused for l minute. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. While confused, the target acts as if it were affected by the confusion spell and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
>
>***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly humanoid of size Medium or Small. The effect ends if tne hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no tentacles, but someone touching her shoulder might feel the tentacles. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

## Green Hag
The wretched and hateful green hags dwell in dying forests, lonely swamps, and misty moors, making their homes in caves. Green hags love to manipulate other creatures into doing their bidding, masking their intentions behind layers of deception. They lure victims to them by mimicking voices calling out for help, or drive unwanted visitors away by imitating the cries of fierce beasts.

***Obsession with Tragedy.*** Green hags revel in the failings and tragedies of other creatures. They derive joy from bringing people low and seeing hope turn into despair, not just for individuals but also for whole nations.

## Howling Hag
Howling hags prefer to live near or within the communities of the humanoids they prey upon, usually hiding within towns and cities. These hags hide their true form, which is a sickly yellow or tan color, wrinkled, and sagging, behind a carefully-crafted illusory disguise, living as beautiful performers, artists, merchants, and even courtesans. Howling hags especially enjoy any role that enables them to make use of their alluring singing or speaking voice. They use the opportunities afforded by these personas to strike at their victims, invisibly carrying them away when they won't be heard or tearing them apart with both claws in one deadly embrace.

***Masters of Wind.*** Howling hags have a magical affinity for wind and sound. They can command winds to push or pull foes, to hurl them into the air, or to create a protective wall When they spread their arms wide, wind rushes to them, carrying them into the air in magical flight. They have excellent hearing even for hags, and their innate magic protects them from losing their hearing.

***Vain of Voice.*** There are few hags more vain than howling hags, and their vanity is the strongest in regards to the sounds of their voices. A howling hag's voice changes while she is disguised by her own magic, becoming lovely and melodic. But a howling hag's true voice -- heard only when her true form is revealed -- is raspy, grating, and physically painful to listen to. Despite this, howling hags believe their true voices to be the most beautiful of alL a voice saved as a gift for those they devour. They are remarkably easy to flatter when it comes to their true voices, but insulting one's voice will greatly enrage the hag.

While a creature is deafened in this way, it is confused, giving it disadvantage on attack rolls, Intelligence checks, and Wisdom checks. Other howling hags are immune to this ability.

## Night Hag
Sly and subversive, night hags want to see the virtuous turn to villainy: love turned into obsession, kindness turned to hate, devotion to disregard, and generosity to selfishness. Night hags take perverse joy in corrupting mortals.

Night hags were once creatures of the Feywild, but their foulness saw them exiled to Hades long ago, where they degenerated into fiends. The night hags have long since spread across the Lower Planes.

***Night Hag Items.*** A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself.

* *Heartstone.* This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.

* *Soul Bag.* When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).

If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.

***Soulmongers.*** While a humanoid sleeps, a night hag can straddle the person ethereally and intrude upon its dreams. Any creature with truesight can see the hag's spectral form straddling its prey. The ethereal hag fills her victim's head with doubts and fears, in the hope of tricking it into performing evil acts in the waking world. The hag continues her nightly visitations until the victim finally expires in its sleep. If the hag has driven her victim to commit evil deeds, she traps its corrupted soul in her soul bag for transport to Hades.

>
>***Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

## Sea Hag
Sea hags live in dismal and polluted underwater lairs, surrounded by merrow and other aquatic monsters.

Beauty drives a sea hag to fits of anger. When confronted with something beautiful, the hag might simply attack it or deface it. If something beautiful gives hope, a sea hag wants it to cause despair. If it inspires courage, the sea hag wants it to cause fear.

***Ugly Inside and Out.*** Sea hags are by far the ugliest of all hags, with slimy scales covering their pallid skin. A sea hag's hair resembles seaweed and covers her emaciated body, and her glassy eyes seem as lifeless as a doll's. Although a sea hag can hide her true form under a veil of illusion, the hag is cursed to forever appear ugly. Her illusory form appears haggard at best.

>***Horrific Appearance.*** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours. Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.

>
>***Death Glare.*** The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.
>
>***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

## Storm Hag
A storm hag spends most of her time watching the weather and planning. She appears at first as a shrunken elderly woman with wiry and scattered hair that often looks like a gray thundercloud, and she greets visitors warmly. Yet behind this congenial mask they present for first impressions, these hags are just as malicious as any other. These sea witches are fond of deceptive deals and trades, and frequently make victims of both Undersea folk as well as "land-dweller" folk. To the Undersea folk, she will often appear as a elderly female triton or merfolk; to the Abovesea, typically human. Their true forms have bone-white skin that is covered in twisted electrical scars, but they reveal these forms only right before they finally consume a hapless and ruined victim.

Storm hags take sadistic joy in making bargains, contracts, and deals that turn unexpectedly against their victims and ruin their lives - more than any other kind of hag. These hags always prefer to use such a bargain when inflicting suffering, and find the chaotic nature of other hags to be distasteful at best.

***Weather Diviners.*** The sky and the movement of clouds - or the currents of the ocean - are like a swirling map of the future to the eldritch eyes of an aquatic storm hag. They use these weather auguries to inform their decisions when making their dark bargains, as well as using the information as bargaining chips directly.

***Bottling a Storm.*** Storm hags gain their name not only from their innate affinity for storms, but also from their practice of capturing pieces of storm clouds. These hags venture into thunderstorms armed with special magic bottles that they use to siphon a chunk of the cloud's primal magic, sealing the bottle to contain it. They use these bottled storms to focus their magic, to observe in lieu of real storms, or even to unleash as a measure of self-defense. Adventurers who slay a storm hag often make use of the bottled storms she has lining the shelves inside of her lair.

Some storm hags can animate small clouds to sit and ride upon to fly through the sky without effort. Such a cloud acts as a carpet of flying that can be contained or released from a bottle by speaking its command word Capricious Wrath. While storm hags excel at hiding their wicked nature behind a mask of friendly warmth, their true emotions are always swirling underneath the surface, ready to be unleashed at a moment's notice. The wrong move or word can take a storm hag from dignified friendliness into a tempestuous rage. Should you manage to outsmart them in one of their dark bargains, you may find the storm hag's rage to be neverending, and legends say her wrath may persist in some eldritch form even after her death ...

>***Cloud Form.*** When the hag would be hit by a melee attack, she can transform into a cloud for a moment (or a cloud of black ink when used underwater), causing the attack to miss. When she does, she can fly or swim up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks before she returns to normal, at which point she falls if she is still aloft and cannot fly.

## Troll Hag
A supremely ugly female troll that has been granted the power of a hag. Some hags take a liking to their female troll minions, and, finding a kindred spirit in them, they bestow their newly adopted daughter with some of their dark power. The troll may find some difficulty in properly using the new power it has been given, but she will be a serious threat none the less.

## Withering Hag
A necromancer that knows the proper rituals can raise a dead hag as an undead called a withering hag, named for not only their appearance but also their innate ability to drain youth and vitality with a touch. Withering hags come in every shape and size that living hags do. True to their name, they have withered skin that complements their thinning hair and skeletal frames.

Withering hags typically lurk in the same areas where they were once defeated, nursing their ancient grudges and plotting new ways to achieve their final revenge as they wait in the dark for hapless victims to wander by. 

***Seekers of Youth.*** Withering hags are desperate to take back the life and vitality that they have lost. Draining the youth from victims temporarily sates their lust for vital energy, but no matter how much they drain, the withering hag can't return itself to life. Despite this fact, most withering hags have convinced themselves to the contrary. They are recklessly eager to drain new victims.

***Spectral Entourage.*** With her talents for trickery, a withering hag usually has little difficulty in convincing other vengeful undead, such as specters and ghosts, to join her cause. Withering hags naturally attract these spirits because of their foul aura. Once they are allied, the spirits stay near to the hag, ready to defend her. 

***Undead Nature.*** A withering hag does not require air, drink, or sleep.

***Covens.*** Withering hags can't form a proper coven because of their undead nature. Withering hags often collect in groups of three despite this, pantomiming the rituals of a proper coven of living hags.
