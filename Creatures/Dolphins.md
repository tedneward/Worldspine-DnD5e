## Dolphin
Dolphins are symbols of wisdom and playfulness among the sea folk of many worlds. Found in oceans and in the Elemental Plane of Water, dolphins are befriended by druids and rangers, and many tales speak of dolphins that appeared out of nowhere to protect swimmers from sharks and other aquatic predators.

## Dolphin Delighter
In the Feywild, dolphin delighters brighten the moods of those who travel the seas of the Domains of Delight. Telepathically singing sea chanteys, these dolphins leap and teleport through the luminous waters of Faerie and the Material Plane, and they are faithful allies to any who battle the forces of gloom and brutality under the waves.

Dolphin delighters often accompany groups of sea elves, tritons, and tortles as guardians and friends.
