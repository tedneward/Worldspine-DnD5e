# Snakes
Armless (usually) and legless reptiles, snakes are common to many parts of Azgaarnoth, and not particularly threatening, with the exception of a few species. They are often found around farms throughout Azgaarnoth, as they are excellent defenses against rodents, and some Hordes villages have festivals in honor of the common garden snake. They are often considered a good-luck charm.

A flying snake is a brightly colored, winged serpent found in remote jungles. Some tribes and clans, particularly among the Hordes, domesticate flying snakes to serve as messengers that deliver scrolls wrapped in their coils.

## Giant Constrictor Snake
As if the normal-sized anaconda or python weren't bad enough, some wizards went and doubled their size, and discovered to their horror that the breed was able to successfully replicate. Giant constrictor snakes are usually found in the most remote jungle and marshland areas, but reports of such snakes in the trees in Northern Bedia keep even the most fearless Bedian settler up late at night.

## Nightstriker Serpent
Nightstriker serpents are nocturnal ambush predators with scales as dark as the night sky and hearts just as dark. A nightstriker serpent's venom is considerably more potent than that of an ordinary snake, but by far the most terrifying thing about them is the fact that they seem to meld with ambient darkness, such that they are almost never seen by their victims until it is too late.

A nightstriker serpent's body is composed partly of shadow, so it is immune to poison and has some measure of resistance to several forms of destructive energy and conventional weapons.
