## Polar Bear
Ranging in bitterly-cold climates, polar bears often operate in small packs of family units, where cubs will be sheltered, fed, and taught to hunt by paired-off polar bear parents. When the cubs are old enough to hunt on their own, the unit breaks up and the bears hunt alone until mating season.
