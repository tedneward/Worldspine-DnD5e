# Whales
Most whales are spotted at a distance far from the shores of Azgaarnoth; some, however, journey closer to shore (often due to divine influence), and orca (killer whale) pods have been spotted routinely making yearly migrations from the [Deepwaters](../Geography/Deepwaters.md) to the Great Northern Ocean and back again.

## Killer Whale
The orca are generally unwilling to interfere with boats (regardless of size), but have been observed aggressively attacking those ships that seek to harm them.
