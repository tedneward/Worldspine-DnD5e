## Hexwraith
The first sightings of the hexwraiths are shrouded in mystery, but it is said that they are created on the cursed night of Hexensnacht, the first day of the New Year, tearing their way into the mortal realm from the bowels of the underworld. The hexwraith's shade-like existence leaves it with a hunger that only the succour of a damned soul can sate. Once the curse of the hexwraiths has been laid upon their prey, there can be no escapeâ€”the spectral horsemen can hurtle across rivers and pass through mountainsides on their ghost steeds without slowing their headlong charge.

***Ethereal Riders.*** Hexwraiths are able to move from the realm of spirits to the mortal world and back again at will. They share many similarities with cairn wraiths, though they are not bound to places of death and grief, but instead are able to roam freely. The scythe-like weapons they use to slay their prey would be lethal enough in the material realm, but because the hexwraiths shimmer between worlds, their spirit scythes are able to pass through plate armour or scaled dragon hide without hindrance.

***Soul Harvesters.*** A single blow from a phantom scythe can snatch away a mortal's essence whilst leaving his physical form completely unharmed. It is these strange weapons that earn the hexwraiths their nickname of 'reaper knights', for they harvest the souls of the living just as a farmer reaps his crop. A soul taken by a hexwraith does not dissipate altogether, but is instead absorbed by the spectre that took it. These dread reapers hence burn with flickering flame; all that is left of the horrified spirits they have stolen from the mortal realm.

***Horsemen of Fear.*** The sight of a pack of cackling hexwraiths approaching fast, phantom scythes held high and unnatural soul fires flickering from their eye sockets, is enough to chill the blood of even the most seasoned warrior and send them fleeing. Able to glide through all physical obstacles, whether it would be stone or flesh, these hexwraiths are hard to defeat by simple mortal weapons. It is only with faith and the use of magical spells and items that one would have a better chance of harming a hexwraith in combat.

***Undead Nature.*** A hexwraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
