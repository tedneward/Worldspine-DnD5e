Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens. They are descended from humans with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities.

An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being – usually a deva – provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.

During it, the aasimar sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of its turns, it and each creature within 10 feet of it take radiant damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each of the aasimar's turns, it can deal extra radiant damage to one target when it deals damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals the aasimar's level.
