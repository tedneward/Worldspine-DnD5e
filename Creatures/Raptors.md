## Giant Eagle
A giant eagle is a noble creature that speaks its own language and understands speech in the Common tongue. A mated pair of giant eagles typically has up to four eggs or young in their nest (treat the young as normal eagles).

Most giant eagles are found in the foothills and mountains of the [Daw Mountains](../Geography/DawMountains.md), though many mated pairs also find nesting near shores (and the plentiful fish out in the water) to be a good decision.

## Greater Giant Eagle
Some of the mightest of raptors, greater giant eagles are masters of mountain aeries and the skies around them. It is widely believed that greater giant eagles are blessed by the good gods of the air, gifted with powers and abilities beyond those of normal beasts. In addition to their own tongue, greater giant eagles can speak Auran and Common, and are at times persuaded to engage in mortal affairs or pair off with druids of sufficient stature. Packs of greater giant eagles (and sometimes aided by giant eagles) have been known to hunt down rocs and kill them.

## Swarm of Ravens
A swarm of ravens isn't an ordinary or benign assemblies of bird. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A hag, for example, might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.

## Roc
At first sight, a roc's silhouette looks much like any other bird of prey. As it descends, however, its unearthly size becomes terrifyingly clear. In flight, a roc's wingspan spreads two hundred feet or more. At rest, perched upon the mountain peaks that are its home, this monstrous bird rivals the oldest dragons in size.

***Sky Titans.*** In the ancient days when giants battled dragons for control of the world, Annam, the father of the giant gods, created the rocs so that his worshipers might challenge the dragons' dominance of the air. When the war ended, the rocs were freed from giant domination and spread throughout the world.

Though cloud giants and storm giants sometimes tame these great birds, rocs treat even giants as potential prey. They fly great distances in search of food, soaring high above the clouds to reach their favored hunting grounds. A roc seldom hunts swift or small creatures, and it ignores towns and forests where prey can easily take cover. When it locates a large and slow-moving target such as a giant, a whale, or an elephant, a roc dives down to snatch its prey in its massive talons.

***Remote and Alone.*** Rocs are solitary creatures that can live for centuries. They lair in nests made from trees, tents, broken ships, and the remains of caravans they carry off, placing these massive tangles in mountain clefts out of the reach of lesser creatures.

Sometimes a roc's nest contains treasures from the caravans or ships they raid, but these creatures are heedless of such baubles. More rarely, a nest holds eggs that are taller than a human, produced by the rocs' infrequent mating.
