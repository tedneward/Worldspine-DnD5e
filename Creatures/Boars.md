# Boars
Larger relatives of the pig family, boars are generally not aggressive unless attacked or provoked, after which they become fiercely violent. Many's the knight out boar hunting that underestimates these animals and comes back empty-handed and deeply wounded. Many's also the knight out boar hunting that finds hunting a giant boar to be a very, very different prospect than a normal-sized one.

## Giant Boar
The giant boar is less common than its regular-sized cousin, but still relatively easy to find all across Azgaarnoth. Most communities tend to give these ones a wide berth, though will sometimes put together a raiding party to take one down either out of hunger, or out of defense of their crops.

### Environment
Forest, Grassland, Hill, Conjured/Summoned
