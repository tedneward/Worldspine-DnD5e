# Golems
Golems are made from humble materials — clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone — but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator's orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.

The creation of golems was once a widely-known art, but today, remains closely-held knowledge by those few who understand it.

***Spirits bound to Material Form.*** The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem's creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.

After constructing the body, the golem's creator infuses it with either a fraction of the creator's own will. Doing so makes the golem entirely an automaton. Sometimes, however, a creator imbues the golem with a [spirit](../Religions/Spirits.md)--perhaps a bit of essence from the Elemental Plane of Earth, perhaps a fraction of the spirit of a bubbling lava pit, even sometimes an ancestral spirit. In these cases, the spirit might retain some of its independence of its earlier existence, and be more than just an automaton, but capable of independent thought and action--which in itself may be curse as much as blessing.

***Ageless Guardians.*** Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.

A golems can be created with a special amulet or other item (typically an [*ornament*](../Magic/Items/index.md#residual-items)) that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master. Golems fashioned eons ago are often separated widely from their controlling *ornaments*, and treasure seekers often wander bazaars and junk shops, carefully examining the "worthless" trinkets for that spark that suggests a mystical link.

***Blind Obedience.*** When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can't fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently — or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.

A golem infused by it's creator's will can't think or act for itself; though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can't be reasoned with or tricked with words. However, if the golem was infused by a spirit, if that spirit is of strong enough will and retains enough of itself during the binding process, it can sometimes (DM's discretion) act of its own accord, though it can never directly disobey the orders of its original creator (or any who are attuned to the *ornament* that controls it).

***Constructed Nature.*** A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Clay Golem
![](Golem-Clay.png)

Sculpted from clay, this bulky golem stands head and shoulders taller than most Medium-sized creatures. It is humanoid shaped, but its proportions are off.

Clay golems are often divinely endowed with purpose by priests of great faith. However, clay is a weak vessel for life force. (Clay golems infused with will usually last no longer than a decade at most.) For this reason, most golem creators choose to infuse spirit rather than will. If the spirit-infused golem is damaged, the spirit can break free of the creator's control. Such a golem runs amok, smashing everything around it until it is destroyed or completely repaired.

## Flesh Golem
A flesh golem is a grisly assortment of humanoid body parts stitched and bolted together into a muscled brute imbued with formidable strength. Its brain is capable of simple reason, though its thoughts are no more sophisticated than those of a young child. The golem's muscle tissue responds to the power of lightning, invigorating the creature with vitality and strength. Powerful enchantments protect the golem's skin, deflecting spells and all but the most potent weapons.

A flesh golem lurches with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body. Its dead flesh isn't an ideal container for an elemental spirit, which sometimes howls incoherently to vent its outrage. If the spirit breaks free of its creator's will, the golem goes berserk until calmed, or until its shell of flesh is destroyed or completely healed.

>The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk.

## Iron Golem
The mightiest of the golems, the iron golem is a massive, towering giant wrought of heavy metal. An iron golem's shape can be worked into any form, though most are fashioned to look like giant suits of armor. Its fist can destroy creatures with a single blow, and its clanging steps shake the earth beneath its feet. Iron golems wield enormous blades to extend their reach, and all can belch clouds of deadly poison.

An iron golem's body is smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures. Though other golems bear weaknesses inherent in their materials or the power of the elemental spirit bound within them, iron golems were designed to be nearly invulnerable. Their iron bodies imprison the spirits that drive them, and are susceptible only to weapons imbued with magic or the strength of adamantine.

## Stone Golem
Stone golems display great variety in shape and form, cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Though most bear humanoid features, stone golems can be carved in any form the sculptor can imagine. Ancient stone golems found in sealed tombs or flanking the gates of lost cities sometimes take the forms of giant beasts.

Like other golems, stone golems are nearly impervious to spells and ordinary weapons. Creatures that fight a stone golem can feel the ebb and flow of time slow down around them, almost as though they were made of stone themselves.

>***Slow (Recharge 5–6).*** The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
