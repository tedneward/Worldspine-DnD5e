# Sea Horses
Sea horses are common to the waters around Azgaarnoth, and "flocks" of both normal- and giant-sized sea horses can often be spotted from ships as they pass through the [Deepwaters](../Geography/Deepwaters.md).

## Sea Horse
The normal-sized sea horse is generally too small to be of any interest (or bother) to anything larger than a goldfish. It has no effective attacks or actions.
