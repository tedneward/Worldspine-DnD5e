>***Disciple of Life.*** Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
>
>***Shelter of the Faithful.*** You can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

>#### Description
>***Personality Trait.*** I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation.
>
>***Ideal: Change.*** We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world.
>
>***Bond.*** Everything I do is for the common people.
>
>***Flaw.*** I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.
>
>***Background: Acolyte.*** You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric â€“ performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
>
>***Race: Dragonborn.*** Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
>
>***Red Dragonborn.***
>
>***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.
>
>***Divine Domain: Life.*** The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy -- one of the fundamental forces of the universe -- that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath.
