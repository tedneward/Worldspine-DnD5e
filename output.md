>___
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Position of Privilege.*** Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>***Unarmored Defense.*** While you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 12. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. It ends early if you fall unconscious or if your turn ends and you have not attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then.

>#### Description
>***Personality Trait.*** The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.
>
>***Ideal: Power.*** If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do.
>
>***Bond.*** My loyalty to my sovereign is unwavering.
>
>***Flaw.*** I hide a truly scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever.
>
>***Background: Noble.*** You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.
>
>***Race: Elf.*** Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.
>
>***Subrace: High Elf.*** As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic.
>
>***Class: Barbarian.*** Barbarians are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.
