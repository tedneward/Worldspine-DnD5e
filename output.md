You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.

>
>***Supreme Healing.*** When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.
>
>#### Actions
>***Channel Divinity: Preserve Life.*** You present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore 100 hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.
>
>***Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.*** You can use one of your uses of Channel Divinity to turn undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, if it is a CR of 4 or lower it is destroyed; otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

>#### Description
>***Race: Tiefling.*** Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle's, and some spiral upward like an antelopes' horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors — black, red, white, silver, or gold — with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.
>
>***Criminal Specialty: Blackmailer.***
>
>***Personality Trait.*** The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.
>
>***Ideal: Freedom.*** Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them.
>
>***Bond.*** I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.
>
>***Flaw.*** When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
>
>***Background: Criminal.*** You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You're far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.
>
>***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.
>
>***Divine Domain: Life.*** The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy -- one of the fundamental forces of the universe -- that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath.
