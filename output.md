>***Athletic.*** When you are prone, standing up uses only 5 feet of your movement. You can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet.
>
>***Beast Shapes.*** You can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.
>
>***Criminal Contact.*** You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Land's Stride.*** Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the Entangle spell.
>
>***Natural Recovery (Recharges on long rest).*** During a short rest, you can recover up to 10 total spell slots of less than 6th level.
>
>***Nature's Sanctuary.*** Creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 17). On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.
>
>***Nature's Ward.*** You can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey.
>
>***Timeless Body.*** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

>***Great Weapon Master.*** Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.
>
>***Wild Companion.*** You expend a use of your Wild Shape to cast [find familiar](http://worldspine.tedneward.com/magic/spells/find-familiar/), without material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after 10 hours.
>
>***Wild Shape (2/Recharges on short or long rest).*** You can magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower. You can stay in a beast shape for 10 hours. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.
>
>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
>
>* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
>
>* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form, For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
>
>* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast.
>
>* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
>
>* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

>#### Description
>***Race: Half-Elf.*** Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.
>
>***Subrace: High Elf.*** One of your parents was a High Elf.
>
>***Criminal Specialty: Fence.***
>
>***Personality Trait.*** I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.
>
>***Ideal: People.*** I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care.
>
>***Bond.*** Someone I loved died because of I mistake I made. That will never happen again.
>
>***Flaw.*** When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
>
>***Background: Criminal.*** You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You're far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.
>
>***Class: Druid.*** Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature, but see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.
>
>***Druidic Circle: Circle of the Land.*** The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.

>***Circle of the Land: Desert.***
