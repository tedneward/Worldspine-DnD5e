>___
>***Blessed Healer.*** When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
>
>***Brave.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
>
>***Channel Divinity (3/Recharges on short or long rest).*** See below for details on each use of your Channel Divinity feature. Creatures that must save against any of your Channel Divinity features do so at DC 15
>
>***Disciple of Life.*** Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
>
>***Halfling Nimbleness.*** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
>
>***Lucky.*** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
>
>***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can attempt to Hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.
>
>***Position of Privilege.*** Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.
>
>***Savage Attacker.*** Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll the weapon's damage dice and use either total.
>
>***Supreme Healing.*** When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.
>
>***War Caster: Concentration.*** You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.
>
>***War Caster: Somaticism.*** You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.
>
>#### Actions
>***Channel Divinity: Preserve Life.*** You present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore 100 hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.
>
>***Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.*** You can use one of your uses of Channel Divinity to turn undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, if it is a CR of 4 or lower it is destroyed; otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

>
>#### Reactions
>***Defensive Parry.*** When you are wielding a finesse weapon with which you are proficient and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can add +7 to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.
>
>***War Caster: Opportunity Cast.*** When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature. This does not count against your ability to cast a spell during your turn.

>#### Description
>***Race: Halfling.*** Halflings are the archetypal small race, and have made beloved thieves and trackers and hosts for millennia.
>
>***Lightfoot Halfling.***
>
>***Personality Trait.*** No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.
>
>***Ideal: Responsibility.*** It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine.
>
>***Bond.*** The common folk must see me as a hero of the people.
>
>***Flaw.*** By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my family.
>
>***Background: Noble.*** You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.
>
>***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.
>
>***Divine Domain: Life.*** The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy -- one of the fundamental forces of the universe -- that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath.
