# Condition: Cursed
When a creature is cursed, they are suffering from an ailment that has been inflicted upon them by some arcane or divine means. Some curses come from magical items, in which case the curse can never be truly broken until the attunement to the item has been severed.

For the duration of the curse, they will be affected as follows:

* They will detect as positive to any [detect curse](../Magic/Spells/detect-curses.md) spell or effect.
* At the DM's option, a cursed creature may suddenly develop disadvantage on an attack or saving throw roll.

Generally curses remain in force until they expire or are removed. A curse may be removed by the application of a [remove curse](../Magic/Spells/remove-curse.md), [greater restoration](../Magic/Spells/greater-restoration.md), or [wish](../Magic/Spells/wish.md) spell or effect.
