# Conditions: Corrupted
Certain magical actions can bring the power of the Abyss to bear directly upon a creature; when this effect is not instantaneous, that creature is **corrupted** and suffers several effects.

* It emits a dim green glow in a 5-foot radius.
* It has disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks.
* It can't benefit from being [invisible](./Invisible.md) (the dim glow outlines the creature's shape, rendering it visible again).

A corrupted creature can use its action to make a Constitution saving throw. It has disadvantage to the save when it is inside Signs of Corruption. On a success, it is no longer corrupted.
