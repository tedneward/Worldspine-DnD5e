# Condition: Silenced
If a creature is silenced, they are unable to produce noise of any form. While silenced, they are affected in the following ways:

* Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible
* Silenced creatures cannot communicate with others except by gestures and action, unless they have some form of telepathy.
* They have advantage on any Stealth checks.
* Creatures with blindsight are at disadvantage on Perception checks to perceive a silenced creature, and are effectively [blinded](Blinded.md) in combat against a silenced creature.

If an area is silenced, then any creatures within that area are unable to produce noise. All noise within the area is removed, providing the following effects:

* Creatures within the silenced area are immune to thunder damage.
* Creatures within the area cannot cast spells or invoke items that have verbal components.
* Creatures within the area cannot communite with others except by gestures and action, unless they have some form of telepathy.
* Any creature within the silenced area has an advantage on Stealth checks.
* Creatures without eyesight or that are [blinded](Blinded.md) automatically fail Perception checks for anything in the silenced area.
* Creatures with blindsight are effectively [blinded](Blinded.md) while in a silenced area.
