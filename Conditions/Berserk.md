# Condition: Berserk
You are temporarily out of your mind with rage, with very little control over your actions.

While a creature is berserk, it has the following effects:

* It must use its action each round to attack the creature nearest to it that it can see (regardless of friend or foe) with a melee weapon. If it can Extra Attacks or Multiattack, it uses that. If the current target falls unconscious or dies, the creature moves to attack the next nearest creature. If there are multiple possible targets, it chooses one at random.
* It can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If it was charmed or frightened when it went berserk, the effect is broken.
* The creature cannot attempt any ability check that uses Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
* The creature has disadvantage on any saving throw that uses Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
* The creature must attempt to make a melee weapon attack every round on the nearest creature it can see, regardless of whether that creature would normally be considered an ally or foe.
