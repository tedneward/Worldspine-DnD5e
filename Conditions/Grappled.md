# Condition: Grappled
A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.

The condition ends if the grappler is [incapacitated](./Incapacitated.md).

The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the [thunderwave](../Magic/Spells/thunderwave.md) spell.
