# Condition: Shaken
A creature that is shaken is in between its normal state and [frightened](./Frightened.md).

While shaken, all attacks against the creature are made with advantage.

Creatures that are shaken can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of their turns against the source of the fear (or DC 10 if no obvious DC is given) to recover.

A creature that is shaken has disadvantage on any saving throw against being frightened.
