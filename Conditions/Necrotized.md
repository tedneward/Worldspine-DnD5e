# Condition: Necrotized
When a creature has been subjected to certain kinds of necromantic energies, the energies can sometimes "take root" inside that creature for a period of time, causing it to be *necrotized* for some period of time. Only humanoids and beasts can be necrotized.

While necrotized, there may be some perceptible symptoms for a necrotized creature, such as discoloration of eyes and skin, or coldness of touch, or darkening of veins.

* A necrotized creature is treated as being an undead type by magical effects such as from [cure wounds](../Magic/Spells/cure-wounds.md) or a cleric's [Channel Divinity: Turn Undead](../Classes/Cleric/index.md#channel-divinity-turn-undead) feature.
* The number of hit points regained by the creature when spending Hit Dice is halved.
* The creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws and death saving throws.

Being necrotized can be cured by any application of curative magic.
