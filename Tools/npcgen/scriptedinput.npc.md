>#### Description
>***Race: Dwarf.*** Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.
>
>***Subrace: Mountain Dwarf.*** The hill and mountain dwarves are essentially small genetic differences within the dwarven bloodline, but at this point in Azgaarnoth's history they are essentially meaningless as cultural differentiators--hill dwarves often work in the hills as part of their guild/clan, and mountain dwarves are often found in mountains for similar reasons. In fact, it's more common to see them in cities than in hills or mountains. Most non-dwarves can't even tell the difference between them.
>
>***Criminal Specialty: Pickpocket.***
>
>***Personality Trait.*** I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.
>
>***Ideal: Redemption.*** There's a spark of good in everyone.
>
>***Bond.*** Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.
>
>***Flaw.*** I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying.
>
>***Background: Criminal.*** You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You're far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.
>
>***Class: Barbarian.*** Barbarians are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.
>
>***Primal Path: Path of the Berserker.*** For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end -- that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.
