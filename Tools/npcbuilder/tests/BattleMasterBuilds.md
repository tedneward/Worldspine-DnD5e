### Battle Master Builds
The suite of maneuvers you choose, when combined with a fighting style and feats, allows you to create a broad range of fighters, each with its own flavor and play style. Below are recommendations for how you might build a Battle Master to reflect various types of warriors. Each of these builds contains suggested fighting styles, maneuvers, and feats.

#### Archer
**Fighting Style:** [Archery](Styles.md#archery)

**Maneuvers:** [Disarming Attack](Maneuvers.md#disarming-attack), [Distracting Strike](Manuevers.md#distracting-strike), [Precision Attack](Maneuvers.md#precision-attack)

**Feats:** [Sharpshooter](../Feats/Sharpshooter.md)

You prefer to deal with your enemies from afar, trusting in a well-placed arrow, javelin, or sling bullet to end a fight without a response. You rely on accuracy and probably subscribe to the axiom that "those who live by the sword die by the bow."
