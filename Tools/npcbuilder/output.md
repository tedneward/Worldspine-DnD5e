>***Arcane Recovery.***  Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can regain 1 expended hit die and choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level of 10, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
>
>***Blood Magic: Armor of Vitality.*** While you possess one or more blood points, and you do not wear armor, your AC is 13.
>
>***Blood Magic: Lifeblood.*** While you possess one or more blood points, you gain advantage on your death saving throws.
>
>***Blood Siphon.*** When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee or spell attack, and the creature dies, you gain 1 blood point.
>
>***Burn the Blood.*** Whenever you begin casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals psychic or fire damage, a wave of pain and anguish erupts from you. This wave causes creatures of your choice within 10 feet to suffer psychic or fire damage (you choose each time you activate this feature) equal to half your wizard level.
>
>***Inheritor of Blood.*** Should you drop to 0 hit points and do not die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, one willing creature within 30 feet can expend one hit die and you regain a number of hit points equal to the result. Each time you use this feature after the first, increase the DC by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, reset the DC to 10.
>
>***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.
>
>***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
>
>***Signature Spells.*** You gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
>
>***Spell Mastery.*** By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
>
>***Spellbook.*** Contents: 
>
>***Surprise Attack.*** If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it. You can use this trait only once per combat.
>
>***War Caster: Concentration.*** You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.
>
>***War Caster: Somaticism.*** You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.
>
>***Wellspring of Life.*** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 18-20 on the d20, you regain 1d6 hit points instead of normal.

>#### Reactions
>***Mark of Blood.*** When an attack scores a critical hit against a living creature within 10 feet, you spend 1 blood point. Until the end of your next turn, you gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature.
>
>***War Caster: Opportunity Cast.*** When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature. This does not count against your ability to cast a spell during your turn.
>
>
>#### Bonus Actions
>***Blood Magic.*** You call upon the power of blood by either inflicting a minor (expend 1 hit die, gain 2 blood points) or severe wound (expend 2 hit dice, gain 4 blood points) upon yourself or upon a willing creature within 5 feet of you. Charmed creatures will always be willing, and the expenditure of hit dice does not count as damage or an attack for purposes of ending the charmed effect.
>
>***Blood Magic: Blood Agony.*** When you hit a creature with a melee or spell attack, you expend 1 or more blood points to deal psychic damage to the target, in addition to the damage of the attack. The extra damage is 1d8 for 1 blood point, plus 1d8 for each additional blood point, to a maximum of 5d8.
>
>***Blood Magic: Blood Sense.*** Expend 1 blood point as an action to focus your awareness upon the immediate area to reveal the presence of living creatures. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any beast, giant, or humanoid, within 60 feet that is not behind total cover. You know the type of any being whose presence you sense, but not the identity of the creature.
>
>***Blood Magic: Fortitude of Blood (2/Recharges on short or long rest).*** Expend 1 blood point as a bonus action to gain a +{npc.INTbonus()} bonus to Constitution saving throws, which lasts for 1 minute. You can invoke this ritual twice. Afterward, you cannot perform it again until you finish a short or long rest.
>
>***Soul Burn.*** Expend one or more blood points to create one spell slot. For each blood point you expend, roll 1d6: 7-9 1st; 10-16 2nd; 17-20 3rd; 21-23 4th; 24+ 5th.

>#### Equipment
>Quarterstaff OR dagger

>Component pouch OR Arcane focus
>
>Scholar's pack OR Explorer's pack
>
>***Spellbook.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots; the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp per level of spell.Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Copying a spell from your spellbook into another spellbook costs half this amount (in time and gold), since you know it already.

#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Live and let live/Community/Nation.*

***Motivation:*** *Enacting revenge.*

***Appearance:*** *Young adult*, *Missing fingers.*

***Talents:*** *Unremarkable, can hide in plain sight.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Fidgets all the time.*

***Interactions (with others):*** *Scared*.

***Bond:*** *Protective of a valuable possession.*

***Secret:*** *Committed a crime no one knows about.*

***Flaw:*** *Envies another creature's possessions or station.*

***Race: Bugbear.*** Bugbears were the lazy bullies of the Hordes, and the rest of Azgaarnoth is grateful that these physical specimens of might have generally chosen the easiest path rather than seek to assert themselves collectively as a race. The only members of the Hordes that might have challenged the minotaurs for primacy over the Hordes, bugbears instead chose to focus on their own indolence rather than leadership and control, and the average bugbear continues that tradition to this day.

***Class: Wizard.*** Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.

***Arcane Tradition: Bloodmancer.*** Blood mages learn to heighten their spellcraft by uniting the power of blood and arcane might. Blood is life, and wizards that travel this path of magic view the sanguine fluid flowing through their veins--and others' veins--as a wellspring of arcane power.

***Feat: War Caster.*** You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning useful techniques.
