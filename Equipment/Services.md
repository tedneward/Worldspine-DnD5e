# Equipment: Services
Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming in front of the duke.

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.

Coach/cab: Within a city | 1 cp
Hireling, Skilled | 2 gp per day
Hireling, Untrained | 2 sp per day

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): an artisan, scribe, guide, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. 

Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

## Spellcasting Services
People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs. In general, spellcasting services are available in one of two ways: either the spellcaster is hired to be part of the staff, much as a guard signs on to a caravan or a mercenary to a company, or an individual spell (or spells) can be bought from an organization that offers such singular options.

Most commonly, spellcasting services are available from wizards and clerics. Some druids might (if their deity permits) be available for agricultural spellcasting assitance, and sometimes a sorcerer will rent themselves out if the job is clear, well-defined, and within their range of spells. Pale masters will almost never be interested in "selling" a spell or service, shamans may offer their services to locals but only under specific circumstances, and warlocks are generally only willing to offer their arcane services if it advances the cause of their patron.
