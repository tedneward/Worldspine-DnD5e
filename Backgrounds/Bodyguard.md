# Background: Bodyguard

You were a bright, shining star when you started
your career in the city guard. Perhaps you stopped
a kidnapping attempt on the Prince Consort, or
you were able to discover an imposter sent to
assassinate a high ranking official. Your
willingness to throw yourself into the line of fire
for those above your station caught the eyes of a
powerful employer. Now, you follow around your
designated individual, watching every face and
shadow for potential threat.
