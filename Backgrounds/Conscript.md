D8   Personality Trait 
1   I have the manners of a goat and the grace of an 
ox… and I don’t give a crap. 
2   I never wanted to be in combat, but now I find I 
can’t get enough of it. 
3   If there’s a way to get out of hard work, I’ll find 
it. 
4   Death doesn’t scare me—and that fact scares 
the hell out of me. 
5   Nobody appreciates my sense of gallows humor. 
6   During the fight, I’m numb as a corpse. After it’s 
all over, I shiver like a frightened cat. 
7   I’ve seen so many people die that I have trouble 
remembering faces. 
8   Complaining about bad food, stupid officers, and 
all my aches and misery keeps me sane. 
D6   Ideal 
1   Independence. Nobody gives me orders any 
more. Nobody. (Chaotic) 
2   Survival. The only way to survive is to make 
someone else suffer in your place. (Evil) 
3   Loyalty. Trust in your shield mates is the only 
thing keeping you alive. (Lawful) 
4   Greed. I’ll do anything you want, so long as 
there’s coin involved. (Neutral) 
5   Hope. If we stop the evil threatening our land, 
others won’t have to sacrifice as we did. (Good) 
6   Vengeance. Those who conscripted me and 
destroyed my life must be punished. (Any) 
D6   Bond 
1   I don’t know if my family lives or dies, but one 
day I will find them and return home to them. 
2   I fight so other folks like me won’t have to. I fight 
for a better world. 
3   Those who fight at my side are my brothers and 
sisters, and the only ones worth dying for. 
4   Let the cause be just. Let my life have meaning 
before I die, bleeding and forgotten.  
5   Every victory brings me closer to earning a life 
free of blood, guts, and horror. 
6   Someday, I’ll have my own mercenary company 
to command. 
D6   Flaw 
1   Nobles and officers are only worth one thing: 
killing—assuming you can get away with it. 
2   Honor is for fools, dead men, and officers. 
3   The scars on my body pain me by day; the scars 
on my soul haunt me at night. 
4   Deep down inside, I’m a coward. The day will 
come when I’ll break and run. 
5   The sight of blood and guts makes me sick. 
6   When someone barks orders at me, I obey 
without thinking about it.
