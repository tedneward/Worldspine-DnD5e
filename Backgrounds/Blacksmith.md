# Background: Blacksmith

War never changes. There are winners and losers.
Madmen and kings. Generals and pawns. They all
require one thing in order to fight and die for their
cause: quality craftsmanship. A handful of solid
nails is just as important as a grip of razor sharp
arrowheads when victory is near. A solid lock or
iron gate can repel attackers just as effectively as a
shield wall. One couldn’t defend the motherland
or conquer the infidels without your skills and
hard work.
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, History
Tool Proficiencies: Smith’s tools or artisan’s tools
Equipment: A worn and comfortable set of
smith’s or artisan’s tools, a set of common
clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp
Feature: Fixer
By disassembling, tinkering and scrounging, you
can fix or make something that is serviceable, but
not good looking. You can use this ability during a
long rest to repair or remove the Broken Condition
from a weapon or piece or armor (see the broken
condition, pg. 53, Fifth Edition Options by TPK
Games).
Suggested Characteristics
Whether you trained with the finest dwarven
smiths or learned your trade from your father, you
know that decently made equipment is vital to
survival. You have an innate distaste for inferior
craftsmanship, and can spot the difference
between sturdy work and cheap knock offs. At the
end of the day, the ring of hammer on forge is the
most comforting sound you can think of.

themselves, and I intend on giving them the 
means to do so.

the worst possible times.

experience, even if they don’t know it.
