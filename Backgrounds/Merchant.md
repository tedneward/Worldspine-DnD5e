# Background: Merchant

Before becoming an adventurer, you were a successful independent merchant. Your family operated a small number of warehouses, organized caravans, managed stores, or owned a ship, and had trade contacts throughout your region of origin, out to several hundred miles around. Perhaps they import ore, uncut gems, untreated furs, or grain, or they export fine cloth, faceted gems, fine furs, even manufacture a unique liquor. Regardless, you've largely given that life up for some reason and have chosen to seek adventure instead. Nevertheless, the training you received then, and perhaps the contacts you made, serve you well as an adventurer.

## Skill Proficiencies
Insight, Persuasion

## Tool Proficiencies
Vehicles (land) and vehicles (water)

## Equipment
A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a letter of introduction from your family's trading house, and a purse containing 25gp

## Feature: Factor
Although youâ€™ve left the day-to-day life of a merchant behind, your family has assigned you the services of a loyal retainer from the business: a factor, husbanding agent, seafarer, caravan guard, or clerk. This individual is a commoner who can perform mundane tasks for you such as making purchases, delivering messages, and running errands. He or she will not fight for you and will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if frequently endangered or abused. If he or she is killed, the family assigns you another within a few days.

## Alternate Feature: Trade Contact
You and your family have trade contacts such as caravan masters, shopkeepers, sailors, artisans, and farmers throughout the Moonsea region and all along the Sword Coast. Once per game session, when adventuring in either of those areas, you can use those contacts to get information about the local area or to pass a message to someone in those areas, even across the great distance between the two areas.
