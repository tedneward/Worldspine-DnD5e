# Background: Eldritch Legacy
The martial tradition has always thrived in your family, and from an early age your parents expected great deeds and epic accomplishments from you. As you grew and learned, however, you revealed an entirely different sort of talent--you possessed the spark of magic within you.

Regardless whether your family felt disappointment or pleasure at your newfound ability, they invested in a grueling regimen of dual training. By day, weapons practice, armor practice, and endurance drills. By night, studying with an arcane teacher to master the principles of magic. Through sheer perseverance and stubborn determination, you survived your training and became something rare in the world. In combat, you possess the power to slay your enemies with a blade, but you also hold the power to defeat enemies with magic.

## Skill Proficiencies
Arcana, Perception

## Languages
Two of your choice

## Equipment
A journal filled with entries about magic and your discoveries, a letter of introduction from your master, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp

## Feature: Best of Both Worlds
Thanks to your training in both the arcane arts and in the field of martial endeavors, you fit into either world comfortably. Whether you need an audience with a local mages’ guild, or you need a sit-down with a band of mercenaries, you know the customs to observe, the right way to interact with them, and the best approach to take to get a hearing. Outwardly, your personality subtly changes to fit with your surroundings, and your habits adjust accordingly. You can gain audience with wizards, sorcerers, scholars, and their ilk when such worthies would otherwise ignore a warrior, gaining the chance to ask for information or a favor from them. Likewise, you can demand to be heard by mercenaries, soldiers, and battlehardened veterans who normally wouldn’t spare a moment for a magician, asking for a place to rest, loan of equipment, or similar favors.

## Suggested Characteristics
Although other warriors may scoff at your arcane talents, or disdain your book-learning, you have found the dual nature of your training a boon. Before the fight begins, you know what to look for to identify enemy spellcasters and magical effects, and you hold an appreciation for the power magic brings to the battle. Once combat begins, your instincts kick in and you fight with the same measure of skill as any of your more martial brethren. The combination of training and education taught you the values of patience and attention to detail.
