# Background: Field Scholar

As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. You spent your days investigating why the wind blew in a certain direction, or why certain stones turned red, or why certain birds behaved differently around other creatures. In your formative years, you found your way to one of Zhi's great institutes of learning, or a bardic college, or the Great Library, where you were apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. But live your life entirely behind walls? Nothing could drive you further from happiness--knowledge is out, in the world, waiting to be discovered, and you are out to find it.

The most well known of Azgaarnoth's fonts of knowledge is the Great Library, maintained and adminstered by the Brass Order of the Dragon. The Great Library is always in need of those who go out, discover things, and bring back firsthand accounts of what they've found. Yes, knowledge can sometimes be dangerous, but that's part of the job--the best discoveries often come with the greatest risks!

You might be one of the Great Library's own, dedicated to the discovery and enhancement of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world. Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars of the Vault of the Sages in Zhi, or the House of Lore in Bedia, and now you have struck out to increase your knowledge and to make yourself available to help those in other places who seek your expertise.

## Skill Proficiencies
Your choice of Investigation or Perception, plus your choice of one from among Arcana, Nature, and Religion

## Languages
Two of your choice

## Equipment
A set of traveler's clothing, a writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a small penknife), a field notebook in which you capture your notes (with clips for capturing small samples as well), and a pouch containing 10 gp

## FEATURE: LIBRARY ACCESS
Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, or secret to permit anyone immediate access.

You have a working knowledge of your cloister's personnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate those connections with some ease. Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries across the Realms, as professional courtesy shown to a fellow scholar.

## SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Use the tables for the sage background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a cloistered scholar.

Your bond is almost certainly associated either with the place where you grew up or with the knowledge you hope to acquire through adventuring. Your ideal is no doubt related to how you view the quest for knowledge and truth--perhaps as a worthy goal in itself, or maybe as a means to a desirable end.
