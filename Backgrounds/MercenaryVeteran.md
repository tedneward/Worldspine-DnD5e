# Background: Mercenary Veteran
As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you're well
acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a
share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes
and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your
experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of
mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of
events on the battlefield. You might have served with a
large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mintarn,
or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more
than one. (See the "Mercenaries of the North" sidebar for
a collection of possibilities.)
Now you're looking for something else, perhaps
greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to
choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're
leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your
skills are undeniably s uited for battle, so now you fight
on in a different way.
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Persuasion
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set,
vehicles (land)
Equipment: A uniform of your company (traveler's
clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming
set of your choice, and a pouch containing the
remainder of your last wages (10 gp)
FEATURE: MERCENARY LIFE
You know the mercenary life as only someone who has
experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary
companies by their emblems, and you know a little about
any such company, including the names and reputations
of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them
recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where
mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the
language. You can find mercenary work between adventures
sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see
"Practicing a Profession" under "Downtime Activities" in
chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations,
modifying the entries when appropriate to s uit your
identity as a mercenary.
Your bond could be associated with the company you
traveled with previously, or with some of the comrades
you served with. The ideal you embrace largely depends
on your worldview and your motivation for fighting.
