# Background: Bounty Hunter

Most of the time, the constables, sheriffs, and
watchmen of the world capture the bad guys and
administer the necessary justice. From time to
time, however, the worst, most despicable crooks
and con men elude the authorities and run for
freedom. Left to their own, these scum almost
certainly commit more crimes and hurt more
people. That’s where you come in.
As a bounty hunter, you travel from town to
town and village to village in search of the
worst of the worst. You track down and
apprehend those criminals who’ve escape
justice. At the same time, you earn a living, so
it’s a win-win sort of situation. If there are times
where you end up capturing an innocent man,
well, that’s not your problem, so long as you get
paid.
Give consideration to your former life as a bounty
hunter. What started you in the profession, and
what convinced you to get out? Did you have
regular clients, or did you take whatever work
you could find? Which criminal proved the most
dangerous or challenging to hunt down? Did you
work with a crew, or did you prefer to remain
solo? You and your GM can discuss the campaign
regions in which you served as a bounty hunter,
and what sorts of criminals you typically
pursued. Perhaps you usually served the forces of
law and order, but at other times--when you
needed the coin--you might have worked for other
criminals or shady organizations who wanted
people retrieved.

Skill Proficiencies: Investigation, Survival

forgery kit, or thieves’ tools

Equipment: A set of tools of your choice (disguise
kit, forgery kit, or thieves’ tools), a set of manacles
or similar restraints, collection of wanted posters
and bounty claims, a set of traveler’s clothes, and

Feature: Bloodhound
You possess a special sense for locating refuges,
hideouts, and sanctuaries to which escapees and
fugitives are likely to flee. You also have a good
instinct for the best tactic for extracting
information from a contact, be it through bribery,
intimidation, flattery, or outright lies. When you
question an individual regarding a target you are
hunting, be it a person or object, you know which
skill stands the highest chance of success (typically
Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion, but other
skills may work better in certain circumstances).
Suggested Characteristics
Your line of work often involves dogged, patient
legwork, including interrogating witnesses,
identifying tracks, gathering rumors and hints,
and uncovering local hiding spots. These long
periods of investigation are then punctuated
by brief, explosive moments of pursuit and
violence. You’ve learned not to trust anyone, and
you’ve come to understand that every person--
good or bad--has a reason for what they do. Those
reasons may prove foolish or ignorant, but that
does not discount those motives.
As a bounty hunter, you’ve learned that few
people respect you, and nobody likes it when you
show up. The crooks hate and fear you because
you represent imprisonment or worse. The
officials and law officers look down on you as
somehow corrupt and greedy. Nobody likes you,
but sooner or later, everyone needs your special
services. Hate, fear, scorn, or disgust, none of
those feelings matter to you; the only thing that
matters is getting paid for a job well done.
D8   Personality Trait

now I’m the one who’s being hunted.

captures. 
5  I cultivate a gruff, unpolished, brutish attitude. It 
helps people underestimate me.

all. I don’t believe anybody’s sob story.

irritable.

the local thieves and cutthroats.

down and hurt them. (Evil)

yourself. I’m in it for the gold. (Evil)

promises. (Lawful) 
D6   Bond 
1   I’ve made a lot of enemies, and now they’re out 
for my blood.

by offering me a stark choice. I must provide the 
same chance to others. 
3   My job is to defend the law by going outside the 
law when necessary.

intend on using those to my own advantage. 
5   The thrill of the chase and the excitement of the 
takedown keep me interested in life.

from the thieves’ guild, I need to pay off my 
debtors… or else. 
D6   Flaw 
1   I always assume you have a sinister ulterior 
motive for everything you do.

risks for the shiny stuff.

Everything I earn goes to strong booze, good

life.

than I care to admit.

when someone is lying to me.
