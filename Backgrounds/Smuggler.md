# Background: Smuggler

Nobles and nations often feel they have a "right" to take a percentage of a merchant's profits. Some see it differently. Law protects "legitimate" trade, trade that passes through the cities' gates, but nobility's historic demand for gold and disdain for certain goods and services create great demand and great risk for smugglers, who shepherd illicit goods and non-humans in and out of cities, villages, and towns by secret routes and hidden trails. Rogues' Guilds always seek to control all of this activity, taking its cut from sanctioned jobs and exacting punishment for independent jobs, but many have found ways to bypass even the illegal organizations that seek a cut of a merchant's hard-earned profits.

Perhaps you trafficked exotic goods to avoid tariffs, or contraband to avoid seizure, or maybe you are sympathetic to those who seek to leave the nation of their birth (or capture) and worked as part of a network of secret routes and safe houses that helps them pass into other lands. Either way, you have contacts in the smuggling community who can help you slip into and out of a city or place unnoticed... for a price.

## Feature: Secret Passage
You can call on your contacts within the smuggling community to secure secret passage into or out of a city for yourself and your adventuring companions, no questions asked, no legal/noble entanglements. Because you’re calling in a favor, you can’t be certain they will be able to help on your timetable or at all (that is, your GM will determine whether you can be smuggled into or out of the city). In return for your passage, you and your companions may owe a Rogues' Guild or the independent smuggler a favor in return and/or may have to pay bribes.
